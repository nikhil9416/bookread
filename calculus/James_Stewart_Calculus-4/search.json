","Parametric surfaces, which are studied in Section 16.6, are frequently used by programmers in creating the sophisticated software used in the development of computer animated ilms like the Shrek series. The software employs parametric and other types of surfaces to create 3D models of the characters and objects in a scene. Color, texture, and lighting is then rendered to bring the scene to life. IN THIS CHAPTER WE STUDY the calculus of vector ields. (These are functions that assign vec- tors to points in space.) In particular we deine line integrals (which can be used to ind the work done by a force ield in moving an object along a curve). Then we deine surface integrals (which can be used to ind the rate of luid low across a surface). The connections between these new types of integrals and the single, double, and triple integrals that we have already met are given by the higher-dimensional versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Green’s Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem. 16 Vector Calculus 1067 Everett Collection / Glow Images Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1068 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus The vectors in Figure 1 are air velocity vectors that indicate the wind speed and direc- tion at points 10 m above the surface elevation in the San Francisco Bay area. We see at a glance from the largest arrows in part (a) that the greatest wind speeds at that time occurred as the winds entered the bay across the Golden Gate Bridge. Part (b) shows the very different wind pattern 12 hours earlier. Associated with every point in the air we can imagine a wind velocity vector. This is an example of a velocity vector ield.

","SECTION 16.1 Vector Fields 1069 In general, a vector ield is a function whose domain is a set of points in R 2 (or R 3 ) and whose range is a set of vectors in V 2 (or V 3 ). 1 Deinition Let D be a set in R 2 (a plane region). A vector ield on R 2 is a function F that assigns to each point s x, yd in D a two-dimensional vector Fs x, yd. The best way to picture a vector ield is to draw the arrow representing the vector Fs x, yd starting at the point s x, yd. Of course, it’s impossible to do this for all points s x, yd, but we can gain a reasonable impression of F by doing it for a few representative points in D as in Figure 3. Since Fs x, yd is a two-dimensional vector, we can write it in terms of its component functions P and Q as follows: Fs x, yd - Ps x, yd i 1 Qs x, yd j - kPs x, yd, Qs x, ydl or, for short, F - P i 1 Q j Notice that P and Q are scalar functions of two variables and are sometimes called scalar ields to distinguish them from vector ields. 2 Deinition Let E be a subset of R 3 . A vector ield on R 3 is a function F that assigns to each point s x, y, zd in E a three-dimensional vector Fs x, y, zd. A vector ield F on R 3 is pictured in Figure 4. We can express it in terms of its com- ponent functions P, Q, and R as Fs x, y, zd - Ps x, y, zd i 1 Qs x, y, zd j 1 Rs x, y, zd k As with the vector functions in Section 13.1, we can deine continuity of vector ields and show that F is continuous if and only if its component functions P, Q, and R are continuous. We sometimes identify a point s x, y, zd with its position vector x - k x, y, zl and write Fs xd instead of Fs x, y, zd. Then F becomes a function that assigns a vector Fs xd to a vec- tor x. EXAMPLE 1 A vector ield on R 2 is deined by Fs x, yd - 2y i 1 x j. Describe F by sketching some of the vectors Fs x, yd as in Figure 3. SOLUTION Since Fs1, 0d - j, we draw the vector j - k 0, 1l starting at the point s1, 0d in Figure 5. Since Fs0, 1d - 2i, we draw the vector k21, 0 l with starting point s0, 1d. Continuing in this way, we calculate several other representative values of Fs x, yd in the table and draw the corresponding vectors to represent the vector ield in Figure 5. s x, yd Fs x, yd s x, yd Fs x, yd s1, 0d k 0, 1d s21, 0d k 0, 21l s2, 2d k22, 2l s22, 22d k 2, 22l s3, 0d k 0, 3l s23, 0d k 0, 23l s0, 1d k21, 0l s0, 21d k1, 0) s22, 2d k22, 22l s2, 22d k 2, 2l s0, 3d k23, 0l s0, 23d k 3, 0l FIGURE 3 Vector field on R@ 0 (x, y) F(x, y) x y FIGURE 4 Vector field on R# y 0 z x (x, y, z) F (x, y, z) FIGURE 5 F(x, y)=_y i+x j F (1, 0) F (0, 3) F (2, 2) 0 x y Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1070 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus It appears from Figure 5 that each arrow is tangent to a circle with center the origin. To conirm this, we take the dot product of the position vector x - x i 1 y j with the vector Fs xd - Fs x, yd: x  Fs xd - s x i 1 y jd  s2y i 1 x jd - 2xy 1 yx - 0 This shows that Fs x, yd is perpendicular to the position vector kx, yl and is therefore tangent to a circle with center the origin and radius | x | - sx 2 1 y 2 . Notice also that | Fs x, yd | - ss2yd 2 1 x 2 - sx 2 1 y 2 - | x | so the magnitude of the vector Fs x, yd is equal to the radius of the circle. ■ Some computer algebra systems are capable of plotting vector ields in two or three dimensions. They give a better impression of the vector ield than is possible by hand because the computer can plot a large number of representative vectors. Figure 6 shows a computer plot of the vector ield in Example 1; Figures 7 and 8 show two other vector ields. Notice that the computer scales the lengths of the vectors so they are not too long and yet are proportional to their true lengths. 5 _5 _5 5 6 _6 _6 6 5 _5 _5 5 FIGURE 6 F( x, y)=k _y, xl FIGURE 7 F(x, y)=k y, sin xl FIGURE 8 F(x, y)=k ln(1+¥), ln(1+≈)l EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the vector ield on R 3 given by Fs x, y, zd - z k. SOLUTION The sketch is shown in Figure 9. Notice that all vectors are vertical and point upward above the xy-plane or downward below it. The magnitude increases with the distance from the xy-plane. y 0 z x ■ We were able to draw the vector ield in Example 2 by hand because of its particularly simple formula.

","SECTION 16.1 Vector Fields 1071 to sketch by hand and so we need to resort to computer software. Examples are shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12. Notice that the vector ields in Figures 10 and 11 have similar formulas, but all the vectors in Figure 11 point in the general direction of the negative y-axis because their y-components are all 22. If the vector ield in Figure 12 represents a velocity ield, then a particle would be swept upward and would spiral around the z-axis in the clockwise direction as viewed from above. z 1 0 _1 y 1 0 _1 x 1 0 _1 FIGURE 10 F(x, y, z)=y i+z j+x k z 1 0 y 1 0 x 1 0 FIGURE 11 F(x, y, z)=y i-2 j+x k z 5 3 1 y 1 0 _1 x 1 0 _1 FIGURE 12 F(x, y, z)= i- j+ k y z x z z 4 _1 _1 _1 EXAMPLE 3 Imagine a luid lowing steadily along a pipe and let Vs x, y, zd be the velocity vector at a point s x, y, zd. Then V assigns a vector to each point s x, y, zd in a certain domain E (the interior of the pipe) and so V is a vector ield on R 3 called a velocity ield. A possible velocity ield is illustrated in Figure 13. The speed at any given point is indicated by the length of the arrow. Velocity ields also occur in other areas of physics. For instance, the vector ield in Example 1 could be used as the velocity ield describing the counterclockwise rotation of a wheel. We have seen other examples of velocity ields in Figures 1 and 2. ■ EXAMPLE 4 Newton’s Law of Gravitation states that the magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects with masses m and M is | F | - mMG r 2 where r is the distance between the objects and G is the gravitational constant. (This is an example of an inverse square law.) Let’s assume that the object with mass M is located at the origin in R 3 . (For instance, M could be the mass of the earth and the origin would be at its center.) Let the position vector of the object with mass m be x - k x, y, zl. Then r - | x | , so r 2 - | x | 2 . The gravitational force exerted on this second object acts toward the origin, and the unit vector in this direction is 2 x | x | Therefore the gravitational force acting on the object at x - k x, y, zl is 3 Fsxd - 2 mMG | x | 3 x [Physicists often use the notation r instead of x for the position vector, so you may see Formula 3 written in the form F - 2smMG yr 3 dr.] The function given by Equation 3 is TEC In Visual 16.1 you can rotate the vector ields in Figures 10–12 as well as additional ields. z y x 0 FIGURE 13 Velocity ield in luid low Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1072 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus an example of a vector ield, called the gravitational ield, because it associates a vector [the force Fsxd] with every point x in space. Formula 3 is a compact way of writing the gravitational ield, but we can also write it in terms of its component functions by using the facts that x - x i 1 y j 1 z k and | x | - sx 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 : Fs x, y, zd - 2mMGx s x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 d 3y2 i 1 2mMGy s x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 d 3y2 j 1 2mMGz s x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 d 3y2 k The gravitational ield F is pictured in Figure 14. ■ EXAMPLE 5 Suppose an electric charge Q is located at the origin. According to Cou- lomb’s Law, the electric force Fs xd exerted by this charge on a charge q located at a point s x, y, zd with position vector x - k x, y, zl is 4 Fsxd - «qQ | x | 3 x where « is a constant (that depends on the units used). For like charges, we have qQ . 0 and the force is repulsive; for unlike charges, we have qQ , 0 and the force is attractive. Notice the similarity between Formulas 3 and 4. Both vector ields are examples of force ields. Instead of considering the electric force F, physicists often consider the force per unit charge: Esxd - 1 q Fsxd - «Q | x | 3 x Then E is a vector ield on R 3 called the electric ield of Q. ■ Gradient Fields If f is a scalar function of two variables, recall from Section 14.6 that its gradient = f (or grad f ) is deined by = f s x, yd - f x s x, yd i 1 f y s x, yd j Therefore = f is really a vector ield on R 2 and is called a gradient vector ield.

Notice also that the gradient vectors are long where the level curves are close to each other and short where the curves are farther apart. That’s because the length of the gradient vector is the value of the directional derivative of f and closely spaced level curves indicate a steep graph. ■ A vector ield F is called a conservative vector ield if it is the gradient of some sca- lar function, that is, if there exists a function f such that F - = f . In this situation f is called a potential function for F. Not all vector ields are conservative, but such ields do arise frequently in physics. For example, the gravitational ield F in Example 4 is conservative because if we deine f s x, y, zd - mMG sx 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 then = f s x, y, zd - -f -x i 1 -f -y j 1 -f -z k - 2mMGx s x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 d 3y2 i 1 2mMGy s x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 d 3y2 j 1 2mMGz s x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 d 3y2 k - Fs x, y, zd In Sections 16.3 and 16.5 we will learn how to tell whether or not a given vector ield is conservative. 1–10 Sketch the vector ield F by drawing a diagram like Figure 5 or Figure 9. 1.

","SECTION 16.2 Line Integrals 1075 In this section we deine an integral that is similar to a single integral except that instead of integrating over an interval fa, bg, we integrate over a curve C. Such integrals are called line integrals, although “curve integrals” would be better terminology. They were invented in the early 19th century to solve problems involving luid low, forces, electric- ity, and magnetism. We start with a plane curve C given by the parametric equations 1 x - x std y - y std a < t < b or, equivalently, by the vector equation rstd - x std i 1 y std j, and we assume that C is a smooth curve. [This means that r9 is continuous and r9 std ± 0. See Section 13.3.] If we divide the parameter interval fa, bg into n subintervals ft i21 , t i g of equal width and we let x i - x st i d and y i - y st i d, then the corresponding points P i s x i , y i d divide C into n subarcs with lengths Ds 1 , Ds 2 , . . . , Ds n . (See Figure 1.) We choose any point P i * s x i * , y i * d in the ith subarc. (This corresponds to a point t i * in ft i21 , t i g.) Now if f is any function of two vari- ables whose domain includes the curve C, we evaluate f at the point s x i * , y i * d, multiply by the length Ds i of the subarc, and form the sum o n i-1 f s x i * , y i * d Ds i which is similar to a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit of these sums and make the following deinition by analogy with a single integral. 2 Deinition If f is deined on a smooth curve C given by Equations 1, then the line integral of f along C is y C f s x, yd ds - lim n l ` o n i-1 f s x i * , y i * d Ds i if this limit exists. In Section 10.2 we found that the length of C is L - y b a ÎS dx dt D 2 1 S dy dt D 2 dt A similar type of argument can be used to show that if f is a continuous function, then the limit in Deinition 2 always exists and the following formula can be used to evaluate the line integral: 3 y C f sx, yd ds - y b a f s x std, y stddÎS dx dt D 2 1 S dy dt D 2 dt The value of the line integral does not depend on the parametrization of the curve, pro- vided that the curve is traversed exactly once as t increases from a to b. t i-1 P¸ P¡ P™ C a b x 0 y t t i t * i P i-1 P i P n P * i (x * i , y * i ) FIGURE 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1076 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus If sstd is the length of C between rsad and rstd, then ds dt - ÎS dx dt D 2 1 S dy dt D 2 So the way to remember Formula 3 is to express everything in terms of the parameter t : Use the parametric equations to express x and y in terms of t and write ds as ds - ÎS dx dt D 2 1 S dy dt D 2 dt In the special case where C is the line segment that joins sa, 0d to sb, 0d, using x as the parameter, we can write the parametric equations of C as follows: x - x, y - 0, a < x < b. Formula 3 then becomes y C f s x, yd ds - y b a f s x, 0d dx and so the line integral reduces to an ordinary single integral in this case. Just as for an ordinary single integral, we can interpret the line integral of a positive function as an area. In fact, if f s x, yd > 0, y C f s x, yd ds represents the area of one side of the “fence” or “curtain” in Figure 2, whose base is C and whose height above the point s x, yd is f s x, yd. EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate y C s2 1 x 2 yd ds, where C is the upper half of the unit circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1. SOLUTION In order to use Formula 3, we irst need parametric equations to repre- sent C. Recall that the unit circle can be parametrized by means of the equations x - cos t y - sin t and the upper half of the circle is described by the parameter interval 0 < t < . (See Figure 3.) Therefore Formula 3 gives y C s2 1 x 2 yd ds - y  0 s2 1 cos 2 t sin tdÎ S dx dt D 2 1 S dy dt D 2 dt - y  0 s2 1 cos 2 t sin td ssin 2 t 1 cos 2 t dt - y  0 s2 1 cos 2 t sin td dt - F 2t 2 cos 3 t 3 G 0  - 2 1 2 3 ■ Suppose now that C is a piecewise-smooth curve; that is, C is a union of a inite number of smooth curves C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C n , where, as illustrated in Figure 4, the initial point of C i11 is the terminal point of C i . Then we deine the integral of f along C as the sum of the integrals of f along each of the smooth pieces of C: y C f s x, yd ds - y C1 f s x, yd ds 1 y C2 f s x, yd ds 1 ∙∙∙ 1 y Cn f s x, yd ds The arc length function s is discussed in Section 13.3. f(x, y) (x, y) C y z x 0 FIGURE 2 0 ≈+¥=1 (y˘0) x y 1 _1 FIGURE 3 0 C£ C™ C¡ C¢ C∞ x y FIGURE 4 A piecewise-smooth curve Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Suppose that s x, yd represents the linear density at a point s x, yd of a thin wire shaped like a curve C. Then the mass of the part of the wire from P i21 to P i in Figure 1 is approximately s x i * , y i * d Ds i and so the total mass of the wire is approximately o s x i * , y i * d Ds i . By taking more and more points on the curve, we obtain the mass m of the wire as the limiting value of these approximations: m - lim n l` o n i-1 s x i * , y i * d Ds i - y C s x, yd ds [For example, if f s x, yd - 2 1 x 2 y represents the density of a semicircular wire, then the integral in Example 1 would represent the mass of the wire.] The center of mass of the wire with density function  is located at the point sx , y d, where 4 x - 1 m y C x s x, yd ds y - 1 m y C y s x, yd ds Other physical interpretations of line integrals will be discussed later in this chapter.

Find the center of mass of the wire if the linear density at any point is proportional to its distance from the line y - 1.

The following formulas say that line integrals with respect to x and y can also be evaluated by expressing everything in terms of t: x - x std, y - y std, dx - x9 std dt, dy - y9 std dt. 7 y C f s x, yd dx - y b a f s x std, y stdd x9 std dt y C f s x, yd dy - y b a f s x std, y stdd y9 std dt It frequently happens that line integrals with respect to x and y occur together.

","1080 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus In general, a given parametrization x - x std, y - y std, a < t < b, determines an orientation of a curve C, with the positive direction corresponding to increasing values of the parameter t. (See Figure 8, where the initial point A corresponds to the parameter value a and the terminal point B corresponds to t - b.) If 2C denotes the curve consisting of the same points as C but with the opposite ori- entation (from initial point B to terminal point A in Figure 8), then we have y 2C f s x, yd dx - 2 y C f s x, yd dx y 2C f s x, yd dy - 2 y C f s x, yd dy But if we integrate with respect to arc length, the value of the line integral does not change when we reverse the orientation of the curve: y 2C f s x, yd ds - y C f s x, yd ds This is because Ds i is always positive, whereas D x i and Dy i change sign when we reverse the orientation of C. Line Integrals in Space We now suppose that C is a smooth space curve given by the parametric equations x - x std y - y std z - z std a < t < b or by a vector equation rstd - x std i 1 y std j 1 z std k.

Now suppose that F - P i 1 Q j 1 R k is a continuous force ield on R 3 , such as the gravitational ield of Example 16.1.4 or the electric force ield of Example 16.1.5. (A force ield on R 2 could be regarded as a special case where R - 0 and P and Q depend only on x and y.) We wish to compute the work done by this force in moving a particle along a smooth curve C. We divide C into subarcs P i21 P i with lengths Ds i by dividing the parameter interval fa, bg into subintervals of equal width. (See Figure 1 for the two-dimensional case or Figure 11 for the three-dimensional case.) Choose a point P i * s x i * , y i * , z i * d on the ith sub- arc corresponding to the parameter value t i * . If Ds i is small, then as the particle moves from P i21 to P i along the curve, it proceeds approximately in the direction of Tst i * d, the unit tangent vector at P i * . Thus the work done by the force F in moving the particle from P i21 to P i is approximately Fsx i *, y i *, z i *d  fDs i Tst i *dg - fFsx i *, y i *, z i *d  Tst i *dg Ds i and the total work done in moving the particle along C is approximately 11 o n i-1 f Fs x i * , y i * , z i * d ? Ts x i * , y i * , z i * dg Ds i where Ts x, y, zd is the unit tangent vector at the point s x, y, zd on C. Intuitively, we see that these approximations ought to become better as n becomes larger. Therefore we deine the work W done by the force ield F as the limit of the Riemann sums in (11), namely, 12 W - y C Fs x, y, zd  Ts x, y, zd ds - y C F  T ds Equation 12 says that work is the line integral with respect to arc length of the tangential component of the force. If the curve C is given by the vector equation rstd - x std i 1 y std j 1 z std k, then Tstd - r9 stdy | r9 std | , so using Equation 9 we can rewrite Equation 12 in the form W - y b a F Fsrstdd  r9std | r9 std | G | r9 std | dt - y b a Fsrstdd  r9 std dt 0 F(x * i , y * i , z * i ) T(t * i ) P i P¸ P i-1 P * i (x * i , y * i , z * i ) y z x P n FIGURE 11 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 16.2 Line Integrals 1083 This integral is often abbreviated as y C F  dr and occurs in other areas of physics as well. Therefore we make the following deinition for the line integral of any continuous vector ield. 13 Deinition Let F be a continuous vector ield deined on a smooth curve C given by a vector function rstd, a < t < b. Then the line integral of F along C is y C F  dr - y b a Fsrstdd  r9 std dt - y C F  T ds When using Deinition 13, bear in mind that Fsrs t dd is just an abbreviation for the vector ield Fs x s t d, y s t d, z s t dd, so we evaluate Fsrs t dd simply by putting x - x s t d, y - y s t d, and z - z s t d in the expression for Fs x, y, zd. Notice also that we can formally write dr - r9 s t d dt. EXAMPLE 7 Find the work done by the force ield Fs x, yd - x 2 i 2 xy j in moving a particle along the quarter-circle rstd - cos t i 1 sin t j, 0 < t < y2. SOLUTION Since x - cos t and y - sin t, we have Fsrs t dd - cos 2 t i 2 cos t sin t j and r9 s t d - 2sin t i 1 cos t j Therefore the work done is y C F  dr - y y2 0 Fsrs t dd  r9 s t d dt - y y2 0 s22 cos 2 t sin t d dt - 2 cos 3 t 3 G 0 y2 - 2 2 3 ■ NOTE Even though y C F  dr - y C F  T ds and integrals with respect to arc length are unchanged when orientation is reversed, it is still true that y 2C F  dr - 2 y C F  dr because the unit tangent vector T is replaced by its negative when C is replaced by 2C.

We also called Equation 1 the Net Change Theorem: The integral of a rate of change is the net change. If we think of the gradient vector = f of a function f of two or three variables as a sort of derivative of f , then the following theorem can be regarded as a version of the Funda- mental Theorem for line integrals. 2 Theorem Let C be a smooth curve given by the vector function rstd, a < t < b.

This can be seen by subdividing C into a inite number of smooth curves and adding the resulting integrals. EXAMPLE 1 Find the work done by the gravitational ield Fsxd - 2 mMG | x | 3 x in moving a particle with mass m from the point s3, 4, 12d to the point s2, 2, 0d along a piecewise-smooth curve C. (See Example 16.1.4.) SOLUTION From Section 16.1 we know that F is a conservative vector ield and, in fact, F - = f , where f s x, y, zd - mMG sx 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 Therefore, by Theorem 2, the work done is W - y C F  dr - y C = f  dr - f s2, 2, 0d 2 f s3, 4, 12d - mMG s2 2 1 2 2 2 mMG s3 2 1 4 2 1 12 2 - mMG S 1 2 s2 2 1 13 D ■ Independence of Path Suppose C 1 and C 2 are two piecewise-smooth curves (which are called paths) that have the same initial point A and terminal point B. We know from Example 16.2.4 that, in general, y C1 F  dr ± y C2 F  dr. But one implication of Theorem 2 is that y C1 = f  dr - y C2 = f  dr whenever = f is continuous. In other words, the line integral of a conservative vector ield depends only on the initial point and terminal point of a curve. In general, if F is a continuous vector ield with domain D, we say that the line inte- gral y C F  dr is independent of path if y C1 F  dr - y C2 F  dr for any two paths C 1 and C 2 in D that have the same initial points and the same terminal points. With this terminol- ogy we can say that line integrals of conservative vector ields are independent of path. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 16.3 The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals 1089 A curve is called closed if its terminal point coincides with its initial point, that is, rsbd - rsad. (See Figure 2.) If y C F  dr is independent of path in D and C is any closed path in D, we can choose any two points A and B on C and regard C as being composed of the path C 1 from A to B followed by the path C 2 from B to A. (See Figure 3.) Then y C F  dr - y C1 F  dr 1 y C2 F  dr - y C1 F  dr 2 y 2C2 F  dr - 0 since C 1 and 2C 2 have the same initial and terminal points. Conversely, if it is true that y C F  dr - 0 whenever C is a closed path in D, then we demonstrate independence of path as follows. Take any two paths C 1 and C 2 from A to B in D and deine C to be the curve consisting of C 1 followed by 2C 2 . Then 0 - y C F  dr - y C1 F  dr 1 y 2C2 F  dr - y C1 F  dr 2 y C2 F  dr and so y C1 F  dr - y C2 F  dr. Thus we have proved the following theorem. 3 Theorem y C F  dr is independent of path in D if and only if y C F  dr - 0 for every closed path C in D. Since we know that the line integral of any conservative vector ield F is independent of path, it follows that y C F  dr - 0 for any closed path. The physical interpretation is that the work done by a conservative force ield (such as the gravitational or electric ield in Section 16.1) as it moves an object around a closed path is 0. The following theorem says that the only vector ields that are independent of path are conservative. It is stated and proved for plane curves, but there is a similar version for space curves. We assume that D is open, which means that for every point P in D there is a disk with center P that lies entirely in D. (So D doesn’t contain any of its boundary points.) In addition, we assume that D is connected: this means that any two points in D can be joined by a path that lies in D. 4 Theorem Suppose F is a vector field that is continuous on an open con- nected region D. If y C F  dr is independent of path in D, then F is a conservative vector field on D; that is, there exists a function f such that = f - F. PROOF Let Asa, bd be a fixed point in D. We construct the desired potential function f by defining f s x, yd - y s x, yd sa, bd F  dr for any point s x, yd in D. Since y C F  dr is independent of path, it does not matter which path C from sa, bd to s x, yd is used to evaluate f s x, yd. Since D is open, there exists a disk contained in D with center s x, yd.

Suppose it is known that F - P i 1 Q j is conservative, where P and Q have continuous irst-order partial derivatives. Then there is a function f such that F - = f , that is, P - -f -x and Q - -f -y Therefore, by Clairaut’s Theorem, -P -y - - 2 f -y -x - - 2 f -x -y - -Q -x 5 Theorem If Fs x, yd - Ps x, yd i 1 Qs x, yd j is a conservative vector ield, where P and Q have continuous irst-order partial derivatives on a domain D, then throughout D we have -P -y - -Q -x The converse of Theorem 5 is true only for a special type of region. To explain this, we irst need the concept of a simple curve, which is a curve that doesn’t intersect itself anywhere between its endpoints. [See Figure 6; rsad - rsbd for a simple closed curve, but rst 1 d ± rst 2 d when a , t 1 , t 2 , b.] In Theorem 4 we needed an open connected region. For the next theorem we need a stronger condition. A simply-connected region in the plane is a connected region D such that every simple closed curve in D encloses only points that are in D. Notice from Figure 7 that, intuitively speaking, a simply-connected region contains no hole and can’t consist of two separate pieces. In terms of simply-connected regions, we can now state a partial converse to Theo- rem 5 that gives a convenient method for verifying that a vector field on R 2 is conserva- tive. The proof will be sketched in the next section as a consequence of Green’s Theorem.

","SECTION 16.3 The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals 1091 6 Theorem Let F - P i 1 Q j be a vector ield on an open simply-connected region D. Suppose that P and Q have continuous irst-order partial derivatives and -P -y - -Q -x throughout D Then F is conservative. EXAMPLE 2 Determine whether or not the vector ield Fs x, yd - s x 2 yd i 1 s x 2 2d j is conservative. SOLUTION Let Ps x, yd - x 2 y and Qs x, yd - x 2 2. Then -P -y - 21 -Q -x - 1 Since -P y-y ± -Qy-x, F is not conservative by Theorem 5. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Determine whether or not the vector ield Fs x, yd - s3 1 2 xyd i 1 s x 2 2 3y 2 d j is conservative.

Therefore we can apply Theorem 6 and conclude that F is conservative. ■ In Example 3, Theorem 6 told us that F is conservative, but it did not tell us how to ind the (potential) function f such that F - = f . The proof of Theorem 4 gives us a clue as to how to ind f . We use “partial integration” as in the following example. EXAMPLE 4 (a) If Fs x, yd - s3 1 2 xyd i 1 s x 2 2 3y 2 d j, ind a function f such that F - = f . (b) Evaluate the line integral y C F  dr, where C is the curve given by rstd - e t sin t i 1 e t cos t j 0 < t <  SOLUTION (a) From Example 3 we know that F is conservative and so there exists a function f with = f - F, that is, 7 f x s x, yd - 3 1 2 xy 8 f y s x, yd - x 2 2 3y 2 Figures 8 and 9 show the vector ields in Examples 2 and 3, respectively. The vectors in Figure 8 that start on the closed curve C all appear to point in roughly the same direction as C. So it looks as if y C F  dr . 0 and therefore F is not conservative. The calculation in Example 2 conirms this impression. Some of the vectors near the curves C1 and C2 in Figure 9 point in approximately the same direction as the curves, whereas others point in the opposite direction. So it appears plau- sible that line integrals around all closed paths are 0. Example 3 shows that F is indeed conservative.

According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion (see Sec- tion 13.4), the force Fsrstdd at a point on C is related to the acceleration astd - r 0std by the equation Fsrstdd - mr 0std So the work done by the force on the object is W - y C F  dr - y b a Fsrstdd  r9 std dt - y b a mr 0std  r9 std dt - m 2 y b a d dt fr9 std  r9 stdg dt (Theorem 13.2.3, Formula 4) - m 2 y b a d dt | r9 std | 2 dt - m 2 f| r9 std | 2 g a b (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus) - m 2 s | r9 sbd | 2 2 | r9 sad | 2 d Therefore 15 W - 1 2 m | vsbd | 2 2 1 2 m | vsad | 2 where v - r9 is the velocity. The quantity 1 2 m | vstd | 2 , that is, half the mass times the square of the speed, is called the kinetic energy of the object. Therefore we can rewrite Equation 15 as 16 W - KsBd 2 KsAd which says that the work done by the force field along C is equal to the change in kinetic energy at the endpoints of C. Now let’s further assume that F is a conservative force field; that is, we can write F - = f . In physics, the potential energy of an object at the point s x, y, zd is defined as Ps x, y, zd - 2f s x, y, zd, so we have F - 2=P.

(See Figure 1. We assume that D consists of all points inside C as well as all points on C.) In stating Green’s Theorem we use the convention that the positive orientation of a simple closed curve C refers to a single counterclockwise traversal of C. Thus if C is given by the vector func- tion rstd, a < t < b, then the region D is always on the left as the point rstd traverses C. (See Figure 2.) (a) Positive orientation y x 0 D C (b) Negative orientation y x 0 D C Green’s Theorem Let C be a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple closed curve in the plane and let D be the region bounded by C. If P and Q have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains D, then y C P dx 1 Q dy - y D y S -Q -x 2 -P -y D dA Recall that the left side of this equation is another way of writing y C F  dr, where F - P i 1 Q j. NOTE The notation  y C P dx 1 Q dy or g C P dx 1 Q dy is sometimes used to indicate that the line integral is calculated using the positive orien- tation of the closed curve C. Another notation for the positively oriented boundary curve of D is -D, so the equation in Green’s Theorem can be written as 1 y D y S -Q -x 2 -P -y D dA - y -D P dx 1 Q dy Green’s Theorem should be regarded as the counterpart of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for double integrals. Compare Equation 1 with the statement of the Funda- mental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, in the following equation: y b a F9 s xd dx - Fsbd 2 Fsad In both cases there is an integral involving derivatives (F9 , -Qy -x, and -P y-y) on the left side of the equation. And in both cases the right side involves the values of the original functions (F, Q, and P) only on the boundary of the domain.

","SECTION 16.4 Green’s Theorem 1097 Green’s Theorem is not easy to prove in general, but we can give a proof for the spe- cial case where the region is both type I and type II (see Section 15.2). Let’s call such regions simple regions. PROOF OF GREEN’S THEOREM FOR THE CASE IN WHICH D IS A SIMPLE REGION Notice that Green’s Theorem will be proved if we can show that 2 y C P dx - 2 y D y -P -y dA and 3 y C Q dy - y D y -Q -x dA We prove Equation 2 by expressing D as a type I region: D - h s x, yd | a < x < b, t 1 s xd < y < t 2 s xd j where t 1 and t 2 are continuous functions. This enables us to compute the double integral on the right side of Equation 2 as follows: 4 y D y -P -y dA - y b a y t2sxd t1sxd -P -y s x, yd dy dx - y b a fPs x, t 2 s xdd 2 Ps x, t 1 s xddg dx where the last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Now we compute the left side of Equation 2 by breaking up C as the union of the four curves C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , and C 4 shown in Figure 3. On C 1 we take x as the parameter and write the parametric equations as x - x, y - t 1 s xd, a < x < b. Thus y C1 Ps x, yd dx - y b a Ps x, t 1 s xdd dx Observe that C 3 goes from right to left but 2C 3 goes from left to right, so we can write the parametric equations of 2C 3 as x - x, y - t 2 s xd, a < x < b. Therefore y C3 Ps x, yd dx - 2 y 2 C3 Ps x, yd dx - 2 y b a Ps x, t 2 s xdd dx On C 2 or C 4 (either of which might reduce to just a single point), x is constant, so dx - 0 and y C2 Ps x, yd dx - 0 - y C4 Ps x, yd dx Hence y C Ps x, yd dx - y C1 Ps x, yd dx 1 y C2 Ps x, yd dx 1 y C3 Ps x, yd dx 1 y C4 Ps x, yd dx - y b a Ps x, t 1 s xdd dx 2 y b a Ps x, t 2 s xdd dx George Green Green’s Theorem is named after the self-taught English scientist George Green (1793–1841). He worked full- time in his father’s bakery from the age of nine and taught himself math- ematics from library books. In 1828 he published privately An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Mag- netism, but only 100 copies were printed and most of those went to his friends. This pamphlet contained a theorem that is equivalent to what we know as Green’s Theorem, but it didn’t become widely known at that time. Finally, at age 40, Green entered Cambridge University as an under- graduate but died four years after graduation. In 1846 William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) located a copy of Green’s essay, realized its signiicance, and had it reprinted. Green was the irst person to try to formulate a mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism. His work was the basis for the subsequent electromag- netic theories of Thomson, Stokes, Rayleigh, and Maxwell. y x 0 a b D C¡ y=g™(x) y=g¡(x) C™ C£ C¢ FIGURE 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

(Try setting up the line integral in Example 2 and you’ll soon be con- vinced!) But sometimes it’s easier to evaluate the line integral, and Green’s Theorem is used in the reverse direction. For instance, if it is known that Ps x, yd - Qs x, yd - 0 on the curve C, then Green’s Theorem gives y D y S -Q -x 2 -P -y D dA - y C P dx 1 Q dy - 0 no matter what values P and Q assume in the region D. Another application of the reverse direction of Green’s Theorem is in computing areas. Since the area of D is yy D 1 dA, we wish to choose P and Q so that -Q -x 2 -P -y - 1 y x C (1, 0) (0, 0) (0, 1) y=1-x D FIGURE 4 Instead of using polar coordinates, we could simply use the fact that D is a disk of radius 3 and write y D y 4 dA - 4 ? s3d 2 - 36 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

A planimeter is a mechani- cal instrument used for measuring the area of a region by tracing its boundary curve. These devices are useful in all the sciences: in biology for measuring the area of leaves or wings, in medicine for measuring the size of cross-sections of organs or tumors, in forestry for estimating the size of forested regions from photographs. Figure 5 shows the operation of a polar planimeter: the pole is ixed and, as the tracer is moved along the boundary curve of the region, the wheel partly slides and partly rolls perpendicular to the tracer arm. The planimeter measures the distance that the wheel rolls and this is proportional to the area of the enclosed region. The explanation as a consequence of Formula 5 can be found in the following articles: ● R. W. Gatterman, “The planimeter as an example of Green’s Theorem” Amer. Math. Monthly, Vol. 88 (1981), pp. 701–4. ● Tanya Leise, “As the planimeter wheel turns” College Math. Journal, Vol. 38 (2007), pp. 24–31. Extended Versions of Green’s Theorem Although we have proved Green’s Theorem only for the case where D is simple, we can now extend it to the case where D is a inite union of simple regions. For example, if D is the region shown in Figure 6, then we can write D - D 1 ø D 2 , where D 1 and D 2 are both simple. The boundary of D 1 is C 1 ø C 3 and the boundary of D 2 is C 2 ø s2C 3 d so, applying Green’s Theorem to D 1 and D 2 separately, we get y C1øC3 P dx 1 Q dy - y D1 y S -Q -x 2 -P -y D dA y C2øs2C3d P dx 1 Q dy - y D2 y S -Q -x 2 -P -y D dA 2 4 0 10 4 3 5 9 8 7 7 0 5 6 Pivot Wheel Pole arm Tracer arm Tracer Pole FIGURE 5 A Keuffel and Esser polar planimeter C ¡ _C £ C£ C™ D¡ D™ FIGURE 6 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1100 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus If we add these two equations, the line integrals along C 3 and 2C 3 cancel, so we get y C1øC2 P dx 1 Q dy - y D y S -Q -x 2 -P -y D dA which is Green’s Theorem for D - D 1 ø D 2 , since its boundary is C - C 1 ø C 2 . The same sort of argument allows us to establish Green’s Theorem for any inite union of nonoverlapping simple regions (see Figure 7). EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate  y C y 2 dx 1 3xy dy, where C is the boundary of the semiannular region D in the upper half-plane between the circles x 2 1 y 2 - 1 and x 2 1 y 2 - 4. SOLUTION Notice that although D is not simple, the y-axis divides it into two simple regions (see Figure 8). In polar coordinates we can write D - hsr, d | 1 < r < 2, 0 <  < j Therefore Green’s Theorem gives  y C y 2 dx 1 3xy dy - y D y F - -x s3xyd 2 - -y s y 2 d G dA - y D y y dA - y  0 y 2 1 sr sin d r dr d - y  0 sin  d y 2 1 r 2 dr - f2cos g 0  f 1 3 r 3 g 1 2 - 14 3 ■ Green’s Theorem can be extended to apply to regions with holes, that is, regions that are not simply-connected. Observe that the boundary C of the region D in Figure 9 con- sists of two simple closed curves C 1 and C 2 . We assume that these boundary curves are oriented so that the region D is always on the left as the curve C is traversed. Thus the positive direction is counterclockwise for the outer curve C 1 but clockwise for the inner curve C 2 . If we divide D into two regions D9 and D 0 by means of the lines shown in Figure 10 and then apply Green’s Theorem to each of D9 and D 0 , we get y D y S -Q -x 2 -P -y D dA - y D9 y S -Q -x 2 -P -y D dA 1 y D0 y S -Q -x 2 -P -y D dA - y -D9 P dx 1 Q dy 1 y -D0 P dx 1 Q dy Since the line integrals along the common boundary lines are in opposite directions, they cancel and we get y D y S -Q -x 2 -P -y D dA - y C1 P dx 1 Q dy 1 y C2 P dx 1 Q dy - y C P dx 1 Q dy which is Green’s Theorem for the region D.

Another occurs when F represents the velocity ield in luid low (see Example 16.1.3). Particles near s x, y, zd in the luid tend to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of curl Fs x, y, zd, and the length of this curl vector is a measure of how quickly the particles move around the axis (see Figure 1). If curl F - 0 at a point P, then the luid is free from rotations at P and F is called irrota- tional at P . In other words, there is no whirlpool or eddy at P. If curl F - 0, then a tiny paddle wheel moves with the luid but doesn’t rotate about its axis. If curl F ± 0, the paddle wheel rotates about its axis. We give a more detailed explanation in Section 16.8 as a consequence of Stokes’ Theorem.

","SECTION 16.5 Curl and Divergence 1107 PROOF Using the deinitions of divergence and curl, we have div curl F - =  s=3 Fd - - -x S -R -y 2 -Q -z D 1 - -y S -P -z 2 -R -x D 1 - -z S -Q -x 2 -P -y D - - 2 R -x -y 2 - 2 Q -x -z 1 - 2 P -y -z 2 - 2 R -y -x 1 - 2 Q -z -x 2 - 2 P -z -y - 0 because the terms cancel in pairs by Clairaut’s Theorem. ■ EXAMPLE 5 Show that the vector ield Fs x, y, zd - x z i 1 xy z j 2 y 2 k can’t be written as the curl of another vector ield, that is, F ± curl G. SOLUTION In Example 4 we showed that div F - z 1 x z and therefore div F ± 0. If it were true that F - curl G, then Theorem 11 would give div F - div curl G - 0 which contradicts div F ± 0. Therefore F is not the curl of another vector ield. ■ Again, the reason for the name divergence can be understood in the context of luid low. If Fs x, y, zd is the velocity of a luid (or gas), then div Fs x, y, zd represents the net rate of change (with respect to time) of the mass of luid (or gas) lowing from the point s x, y, zd per unit volume. In other words, div Fs x, y, zd measures the tendency of the luid to diverge from the point s x, y, zd. If div F - 0, then F is said to be incompressible. Another differential operator occurs when we compute the divergence of a gradient vector ield = f . If f is a function of three variables, we have divs = f d - =  s = f d - - 2 f -x 2 1 - 2 f -y 2 1 - 2 f -z 2 and this expression occurs so often that we abbreviate it as = 2 f . The operator = 2 - =  = is called the Laplace operator because of its relation to Laplace’s equation = 2 f - - 2 f -x 2 1 - 2 f -y 2 1 - 2 f -z 2 - 0 We can also apply the Laplace operator = 2 to a vector ield F - P i 1 Q j 1 R k in terms of its components: = 2 F - = 2 P i 1= 2 Q j 1= 2 R k Note the analogy with the scalar triple product: a  sa 3 bd - 0. The reason for this interpretation of div F will be explained at the end of Section 16.9 as a consequence of the Divergence Theorem. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","1108 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus Vector Forms of Green’s Theorem The curl and divergence operators allow us to rewrite Green’s Theorem in versions that will be useful in our later work. We suppose that the plane region D, its boundary curve C, and the functions P and Q satisfy the hypotheses of Green’s Theorem. Then we con- sider the vector ield F - P i 1 Q j. Its line integral is  y C F  dr -  y C P dx 1 Q dy and, regarding F as a vector ield on R 3 with third component 0, we have curl F - i j k - -x - -y - -z Ps x, yd Qs x, yd 0 - S -Q -x 2 -P -y D k Therefore scurl Fd  k - S -Q -x 2 -P -y D k  k - -Q -x 2 -P -y and we can now rewrite the equation in Green’s Theorem in the vector form 12  y C F  dr - y D y scurl Fd  k dA Equation 12 expresses the line integral of the tangential component of F along C as the double integral of the vertical component of curl F over the region D enclosed by C. We now derive a similar formula involving the normal component of F.

This exercise demonstrates a connection between the curl vector and rotations. Let B be a rigid body rotating about the z-axis. The rotation can be described by the vector w -  k, where  is the angular speed of B, that is, the tangential speed of any point P in B divided by the distance d from the axis of rotation.

","SECTION 16.6 Parametric Surfaces and Their Areas 1111 So far we have considered special types of surfaces: cylinders, quadric surfaces, graphs of functions of two variables, and level surfaces of functions of three variables. Here we use vector functions to describe more general surfaces, called parametric surfaces, and compute their areas. Then we take the general surface area formula and see how it applies to special surfaces. Parametric Surfaces In much the same way that we describe a space curve by a vector function rstd of a single parameter t, we can describe a surface by a vector function rsu, vd of two parameters u and v. We suppose that 1 rsu, vd - x su, vd i 1 y su, vd j 1 z su, vd k is a vector-valued function deined on a region D in the uv-plane. So x, y, and z, the com- ponent functions of r, are functions of the two variables u and v with domain D. The set of all points s x, y, zd in R 3 such that 2 x - x su, vd y - y su, vd z - z su, vd and su, vd varies throughout D, is called a parametric surface S and Equations 2 are called parametric equations of S. Each choice of u and v gives a point on S; by making all choices, we get all of S. In other words, the surface S is traced out by the tip of the position vector rsu, vd as su, vd moves throughout the region D. (See Figure 1.) 0 z x y S r(u, √) 0 √ u D (u, √) r EXAMPLE 1 Identify and sketch the surface with vector equation rsu, vd - 2 cos u i 1 v j 1 2 sin u k SOLUTION The parametric equations for this surface are x - 2 cos u y - v z - 2 sin u FIGURE 1 A parametric surface 39. We have seen that all vector ields of the form F - =t satisfy the equation curl F - 0 and that all vector ields of the form F - curl G satisfy the equation div F - 0 (assuming continuity of the appropriate partial derivatives). This suggests the question: are there any equations that all functions of the form f - div G must satisfy? Show that the answer to this question is “No” by proving that every continuous func- tion f on R 3 is the divergence of some vector ield.

","1112 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus So for any point s x, y, zd on the surface, we have x 2 1 z 2 - 4 cos 2 u 1 4 sin 2 u - 4 This means that vertical cross-sections parallel to the x z-plane (that is, with y constant) are all circles with radius 2. Since y - v and no restriction is placed on v, the surface is a circular cylinder with radius 2 whose axis is the y-axis (see Figure 2). ■ In Example 1 we placed no restrictions on the parameters u and v and so we obtained the entire cylinder. If, for instance, we restrict u and v by writing the parameter domain as 0 < u < y2 0 < v < 3 then x > 0, z > 0, 0 < y < 3, and we get the quarter-cylinder with length 3 illustrated in Figure 3. If a parametric surface S is given by a vector function rsu, vd, then there are two useful families of curves that lie on S, one family with u constant and the other with v constant. These families correspond to vertical and horizontal lines in the uv-plane. If we keep u constant by putting u - u 0 , then rsu 0 , vd becomes a vector function of the single param- eter v and deines a curve C 1 lying on S. (See Figure 4.) r 0 z y x C¡ C™ 0 D √=√¸ (u ¸, √¸) u=u¸ u √ Similarly, if we keep v constant by putting v - v 0 , we get a curve C 2 given by rsu, v 0 d that lies on S. We call these curves grid curves. (In Example 1, for instance, the grid curves obtained by letting u be constant are horizontal lines whereas the grid curves with v constant are circles.) In fact, when a computer graphs a parametric surface, it usually depicts the surface by plotting these grid curves, as we see in the following example. EXAMPLE 2 Use a computer algebra system to graph the surface rsu, vd - ks2 1 sin vd cos u, s2 1 sin vd sin u, u 1 cos vl Which grid curves have u constant? Which have v constant? SOLUTION We graph the portion of the surface with parameter domain 0 < u < 4, 0 < v < 2 in Figure 5. It has the appearance of a spiral tube. To identify the grid curves, we write the corresponding parametric equations: x - s2 1 sin vd cos u y - s2 1 sin vd sin u z - u 1 cos v If v is constant, then sin v and cos v are constant, so the parametric equations resemble those of the helix in Example 13.1.4. Thus the grid curves with v constant are the spiral curves in Figure 5. We deduce that the grid curves with u constant must be the curves 0 (0, 0, 2) (2, 0, 0) x y z FIGURE 2 0 (0 , 3, 2) x y z FIGURE 3 TEC Visual 16.6 shows animated ver- sions of Figures 4 and 5, with moving grid curves, for several parametric surfaces.

","SECTION 16.6 Parametric Surfaces and Their Areas 1113 that look like circles in the igure. Further evidence for this assertion is that if u is kept constant, u - u 0 , then the equation z - u 0 1 cos v shows that the z-values vary from u 0 2 1 to u 0 1 1. ■ In Examples 1 and 2 we were given a vector equation and asked to graph the corre- sponding parametric surface. In the following examples, however, we are given the more challenging problem of inding a vector function to represent a given surface. In the rest of this chapter we will often need to do exactly that. EXAMPLE 3 Find a vector function that represents the plane that passes through the point P 0 with position vector r 0 and that contains two nonparallel vectors a and b. SOLUTION If P is any point in the plane, we can get from P 0 to P by moving a certain distance in the direction of a and another distance in the direction of b. So there are scalars u and v such that P 0 P B - u a 1 v b. (Figure 6 illustrates how this works, by means of the Parallelogram Law, for the case where u and v are positive. See also Exercise 12.2.46.) If r is the position vector of P, then r - OP 0 B 1 P 0 P B - r 0 1 u a 1 v b So the vector equation of the plane can be written as rsu, vd - r 0 1 u a 1 v b where u and v are real numbers. If we write r - k x, y, z l, r 0 - k x 0 , y 0 , z 0 l, a - k a 1 , a 2 , a 3 l, and b - k b 1 , b 2 , b 3 l, then we can write the parametric equations of the plane through the point s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d as follows: x - x 0 1 ua 1 1 v b 1 y - y 0 1 ua 2 1 v b 2 z - z 0 1 ua 3 1 v b 3 ■ EXAMPLE 4 Find a parametric representation of the sphere x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 - a 2 SOLUTION The sphere has a simple representation  - a in spherical coordinates, so let’s choose the angles  and  in spherical coordinates as the parameters (see Section 15.8). Then, putting  - a in the equations for conversion from spherical to rectangular coordinates (Equations 15.8.1), we obtain x - a sin  cos  y - a sin  sin  z - a cos  as the parametric equations of the sphere. The corresponding vector equation is rs, d - a sin  cos  i 1 a sin  sin  j 1 a cos  k We have 0 <  <  and 0 <  < 2, so the parameter domain is the rectangle D - f0, g 3 f0, 2g. The grid curves with  constant are the circles of constant lati- tude (including the equator). The grid curves with  constant are the meridians (semi- circles), which connect the north and south poles (see Figure 7). ■ NOTE We saw in Example 4 that the grid curves for a sphere are curves of constant lati- tude or constant longitude. For a general parametric surface we are really making a map and the grid curves are similar to lines of latitude and longitude. Describing a point on a para- metric surface (like the one in Figure 5) by giving speciic values of u and v is like giving the latitude and longitude of a point.

Then the parametric equations of the cylinder are x - 2 cos  y - 2 sin  z - z where 0 <  < 2 and 0 < z < 1. ■ EXAMPLE 6 Find a vector function that represents the elliptic paraboloid z - x 2 1 2y 2 .

The next example shows two ways to parametrize a cone. EXAMPLE 7 Find a parametric representation for the surface z - 2 sx 2 1 y 2 , that is, the top half of the cone z 2 - 4x 2 1 4y 2 . SOLUTION 1 One possible representation is obtained by choosing x and y as parameters: x - x y - y z - 2 sx 2 1 y 2 So the vector equation is rs x, yd - x i 1 y j 1 2 sx 2 1 y 2 k SOLUTION 2 Another representation results from choosing as parameters the polar coordinates r and . A point s x, y, zd on the cone satisies x - r cos , y - r sin , and One of the uses of parametric surfaces is in computer graphics. Figure 8 shows the result of trying to graph the sphere x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 - 1 by solving the equation for z and graphing the top and bottom hemispheres separately. Part of the sphere appears to be missing because of the rectangular grid system used by the computer. The much better picture in Figure 9 was produced by a computer using the parametric equa- tions found in Example 4. TEC In Module 16.6 you can inves- tigate several families of parametric surfaces.

For instance, let’s consider the surface S obtained by rotating the curve y - f s xd, a < x < b, about the x-axis, where f s xd > 0. Let  be the angle of rotation as shown in Figure 10. If s x, y, zd is a point on S, then 3 x - x y - f s xd cos  z - f s xd sin  Therefore we take x and  as parameters and regard Equations 3 as parametric equations of S. The parameter domain is given by a < x < b, 0 <  < 2. EXAMPLE 8 Find parametric equations for the surface generated by rotating the curve y - sin x, 0 < x < 2, about the x-axis. Use these equations to graph the surface of revolution. SOLUTION From Equations 3, the parametric equations are x - x y - sin x cos  z - sin x sin  and the parameter domain is 0 < x < 2, 0 <  < 2. Using a computer to plot these equations and and then rotating the image, we obtain the graph in Figure 11. ■ We can adapt Equations 3 to represent a surface obtained through revolution about the y- or z-axis (see Exercise 30). Tangent Planes We now find the tangent plane to a parametric surface S traced out by a vector function rsu, vd - xsu, vd i 1 ysu, vd j 1 zsu, vd k at a point P 0 with position vector rsu 0 , v 0 d. If we keep u constant by putting u - u 0 , then rsu 0 , vd becomes a vector function of the single parameter v and defines a grid curve C 1 lying on S. (See Figure 12.) The tangent vector to C 1 at P 0 is obtained by taking the par- tial derivative of r with respect to v: 4 r v - -x -v su 0 , v 0 d i 1 -y -v su 0 , v 0 d j 1 -z -v su 0 , v 0 d k 0 u D √=√¸ (u ¸, √¸) u=u ¸ √ 0 z y x C¡ C™ r u r √ P¸ r 0 z y x ¨ z x (x, y , z) y=ƒ ƒ ƒ FIGURE 10 z y x FIGURE 11 For some purposes the parametric representations in Solutions 1 and 2 are equally good, but Solution 2 might be preferable in certain situations.

","1116 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus Similarly, if we keep v constant by putting v - v 0 , we get a grid curve C 2 given by rsu, v 0 d that lies on S, and its tangent vector at P 0 is 5 r u - -x -u su 0 , v 0 d i 1 -y -u su 0 , v 0 d j 1 -z -u su 0 , v 0 d k If r u 3 r v is not 0, then the surface S is called smooth (it has no “corners”). For a smooth surface, the tangent plane is the plane that contains the tangent vectors r u and r v , and the vector r u 3 r v is a normal vector to the tangent plane. EXAMPLE 9 Find the tangent plane to the surface with parametric equations x - u 2 , y - v 2 , z - u 1 2v at the point s1, 1, 3d. SOLUTION We irst compute the tangent vectors: r u - -x -u i 1 -y -u j 1 -z -u k - 2u i 1 k r v - -x -v i 1 -y -v j 1 -z -v k - 2v j 1 2 k Thus a normal vector to the tangent plane is r u 3 r v - Z i 2u 0 j 0 2v k 1 2 Z - 22v i 2 4u j 1 4uv k Notice that the point s1, 1, 3d corresponds to the parameter values u - 1 and v - 1, so the normal vector there is 22 i 2 4 j 1 4 k Therefore an equation of the tangent plane at s1, 1, 3d is 22s x 2 1d 2 4s y 2 1d 1 4sz 2 3d - 0 or x 1 2y 2 2z 1 3 - 0 ■ Surface Area Now we deine the surface area of a general parametric surface given by Equation 1. For simplicity we start by considering a surface whose parameter domain D is a rectangle, and we divide it into subrectangles R ij . Let’s choose su i * , v j * d to be the lower left corner of R ij .

","SECTION 16.6 Parametric Surfaces and Their Areas 1117 The part S ij of the surface S that corresponds to R ij is called a patch and has the point P ij with position vector rsu i * , v j * d as one of its corners. Let r u * - r u su i * , v j * d and r v * - r v su i * , v j * d be the tangent vectors at P ij as given by Equations 5 and 4. Figure 15(a) shows how the two edges of the patch that meet at P ij can be approxi- mated by vectors. These vectors, in turn, can be approximated by the vectors Du r u * and Dv r v * because partial derivatives can be approximated by difference quotients. So we approximate S ij by the parallelogram determined by the vectors Du r u * and Dv r v *. This parallelogram is shown in Figure 15(b) and lies in the tangent plane to S at P ij . The area of this parallelogram is | sDu r u *d 3 sDv r v *d | - | r u * 3 r v * | Du Dv and so an approximation to the area of S is o m i-1 o n j-1 | r u * 3 r v * | Du Dv Our intuition tells us that this approximation gets better as we increase the number of subrectangles, and we recognize the double sum as a Riemann sum for the double inte- gral yy D | r u 3 r v | du dv. This motivates the following definition. 6 Deinition If a smooth parametric surface S is given by the equation rsu, vd - xsu, vd i 1 ysu, vd j 1 zsu, vd k su, vd [ D and S is covered just once as su, vd ranges throughout the parameter domain D, then the surface area of S is AsS d - y D y | r u 3 r v | dA where r u - -x -u i 1 -y -u j 1 -z -u k r v - -x -v i 1 -y -v j 1 -z -v k EXAMPLE 10 Find the surface area of a sphere of radius a.

","SECTION 16.7 Surface Integrals 1127 Oriented Surfaces To deine surface integrals of vector ields, we need to rule out nonorientable surfaces such as the Möbius strip shown in Figure 4. [It is named after the German geometer August Möbius (1790–1868).] You can construct one for yourself by taking a long rectangular strip of paper, giving it a half-twist, and taping the short edges together as in Figure 5. If an ant were to crawl along the Möbius strip starting at a point P , it would end up on the “other side” of the strip (that is, with its upper side pointing in the opposite direction). Then, if the ant continued to crawl in the same direction, it would end up back at the same point P without ever having crossed an edge. (If you have constructed a Möbius strip, try drawing a pencil line down the middle.) Therefore a Möbius strip really has only one side. You can graph the Möbius strip using the parametric equations in Exercise 16.6.32. A B D C A B C D From now on we consider only orientable (two-sided) surfaces. We start with a sur- face S that has a tangent plane at every point s x, y, zd on S (except at any boundary point). There are two unit normal vectors n 1 and n 2 - 2n 1 at s x, y, zd. (See Figure 6.) If it is possible to choose a unit normal vector n at every such point s x, y, zd so that n varies continuously over S, then S is called an oriented surface and the given choice of n provides S with an orientation. There are two possible orientations for any orient- able surface (see Figure 7). n n n n n n n n n n For a surface z - ts x, yd given as the graph of t, we use Equation 3 to associate with the surface a natural orientation given by the unit normal vector 5 n - 2 -t -x i 2 -t -y j 1 k Î 1 1 S -t -x D 2 1 S -t -y D 2 Since the k-component is positive, this gives the upward orientation of the surface. If S is a smooth orientable surface given in parametric form by a vector function rsu, vd, then it is automatically supplied with the orientation of the unit normal vector 6 n - r u 3 r v | r u 3 r v | and the opposite orientation is given by 2n. For instance, in Example 16.6.4 we found A Möbius strip P FIGURE 4 TEC Visual 16.7 shows a Möbius strip with a normal vector that can be moved along the surface. n¡ n™ 0 y z x FIGURE 6 FIGURE 5 Constructing a Möbius strip FIGURE 7 The two orientations of an orientable surface Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Surface Integrals of Vector Fields Suppose that S is an oriented surface with unit normal vector n, and imagine a luid with density s x, y, zd and velocity ield vs x, y, zd lowing through S. (Think of S as an imagi- nary surface that doesn’t impede the luid low, like a ishing net across a stream.) Then the rate of low (mass per unit time) per unit area is v. If we divide S into small patches S ij , as in Figure 10 (compare with Figure 1), then S ij is nearly planar and so we can approxi- mate the mass of luid per unit time crossing S ij in the direction of the normal n by the quantity s v  nd AsS ij d where , v, and n are evaluated at some point on S ij . (Recall that the component of the vector v in the direction of the unit vector n is v  n.)

","SECTION 16.7 Surface Integrals 1129 If we write F - v, then F is also a vector ield on R 3 and the integral in Equation 7 becomes y S y F  n dS A surface integral of this form occurs frequently in physics, even when F is not v, and is called the surface integral (or lux integral ) of F over S. 8 Deinition If F is a continuous vector ield deined on an oriented surface S with unit normal vector n, then the surface integral of F over S is y S y F  dS - y S y F  n dS This integral is also called the lux of F across S.

One of the important laws of electro- statics is Gauss’s Law, which says that the net charge enclosed by a closed surface S is 11 Q - « 0 y S y E  dS where « 0 is a constant (called the permittivity of free space) that depends on the units used. (In the SI system, « 0 < 8.8542 3 10 212 C 2 yN ? m 2 .) Therefore, if the vector field F in Example 4 represents an electric field, we can conclude that the charge enclosed by S is Q - 4 3 « 0 .

Whereas Green’s Theorem relates a double integral over a plane region D to a line inte- gral around its plane boundary curve, Stokes’ Theorem relates a surface integral over a surface S to a line integral around the boundary curve of S (which is a space curve). Fig- ure 1 shows an oriented surface with unit normal vector n. The orientation of S induces the positive orientation of the boundary curve C shown in the igure. This means that if you walk in the positive direction around C with your head pointing in the direction of n, then the surface will always be on your left. Stokes’ Theorem Let S be an oriented piecewise-smooth surface that is bounded by a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary curve C with positive orientation.

","SECTION 16.8 Stokes’ Theorem 1135 Stokes’ Theorem says that the line integral around the boundary curve of S of the tan- gential component of F is equal to the surface integral over S of the normal component of the curl of F. The positively oriented boundary curve of the oriented surface S is often written as -S, so Stokes’ Theorem can be expressed as 1 y S y curl F  dS - y -S F  dr There is an analogy among Stokes’ Theorem, Green’s Theorem, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. As before, there is an integral involving derivatives on the left side of Equation 1 (recall that curl F is a sort of derivative of F) and the right side involves the values of F only on the boundary of S. In fact, in the special case where the surface S is lat and lies in the xy-plane with upward orientation, the unit normal is k, the surface integral becomes a double integral, and Stokes’ Theorem becomes y C F  dr - y S y curl F  dS - y S y scurl Fd  k dA This is precisely the vector form of Green’s Theorem given in Equation 16.5.12. Thus we see that Green’s Theorem is really a special case of Stokes’ Theorem. Although Stokes’ Theorem is too dificult for us to prove in its full generality, we can give a proof when S is a graph and F, S, and C are well behaved. PROOF OF A SPECIAL CASE OF STOKES’ THEOREM We assume that the equation of S is z - t s x, yd , s x, yd [ D, where t has continuous second-order partial derivatives and D is a simple plane region whose boundary curve C 1 corresponds to C. If the orientation of S is upward, then the positive orientation of C corresponds to the positive orientation of C 1 . (See Figure 2.) We are also given that F - P i 1 Q j 1 R k, where the partial derivatives of P, Q, and R are continuous. Since S is a graph of a function, we can apply Formula 16.7.10 with F replaced by curl F. The result is 2 y S y curl F ? dS - y D y F 2 S -R -y 2 -Q -z D -z -x 2 S -P -z 2 -R -x D -z -y 1 S -Q -x 2 -P -y DG dA where the partial derivatives of P, Q, and R are evaluated at s x, y, t s x, ydd. If x - x std y - y std a < t < b is a parametric representation of C 1 , then a parametric representation of C is x - x std y - y std z - ts x std, y stdd a < t < b George Stokes Stokes’ Theorem is named after the Irish mathematical physicist Sir George Stokes (1819–1903). Stokes was a professor at Cambridge Univer- sity (in fact he held the same position as Newton, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics) and was especially noted for his studies of luid low and light. What we call Stokes’ Theorem was actually discovered by the Scottish physicist Sir William Thomson (1824–1907, known as Lord Kelvin). Stokes learned of this theorem in a letter from Thomson in 1850 and asked students to prove it on an examination at Cambridge University in 1854. We don’t know if any of those students was able to do so. 0 D C S z=g(x, y) C¡ n y z x FIGURE 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","1138 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus and recall that v  T is the component of v in the direction of the unit tangent vector T. This means that the closer the direction of v is to the direction of T, the larger the value of v  T. Thus y C v  dr is a measure of the tendency of the luid to move around C and is called the circulation of v around C. (See Figure 5.)

Then (curl FdsPd<scurl FdsP 0 d for all points P on S a because curl F is contin- uous.

It shows that curl v  n is a measure of the rotating effect of the luid about the axis n. The curling effect is greatest about the axis parallel to curl v. Finally, we mention that Stokes’ Theorem can be used to prove Theorem 16.5.4 (which states that if curl F - 0 on all of R 3 , then F is conservative). From our previous work (Theorems 16.3.3 and 16.3.4), we know that F is conservative if y C F  dr - 0 for every closed path C. Given C, suppose we can ind an orientable surface S whose bound- ary is C. (This can be done, but the proof requires advanced techniques.) Then Stokes’ Theorem gives y C F  dr - y S y curl F  dS - y S y 0  dS - 0 A curve that is not simple can be broken into a number of simple curves, and the integrals around these simple curves are all 0. Adding these integrals, we obtain y C F  dr - 0 for any closed curve C.

Notice its similar- ity to Green’s Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem in that it relates the integral of a derivative of a function (div F in this case) over a region to the integral of the original function F over the boundary of the region. At this stage you may wish to review the various types of regions over which we were able to evaluate triple integrals in Section 15.6. We state and prove the Divergence Theo- rem for regions E that are simultaneously of types 1, 2, and 3 and we call such regions simple solid regions. (For instance, regions bounded by ellipsoids or rectangular boxes are simple solid regions.) The boundary of E is a closed surface, and we use the conven- tion, introduced in Section 16.7, that the positive orientation is outward; that is, the unit normal vector n is directed outward from E. The Divergence Theorem Let E be a simple solid region and let S be the boundary surface of E, given with positive (outward) orientation. Let F be a vec- tor ield whose component functions have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains E. Then y S y F ? dS - y y E y div F dV The Divergence Theorem is sometimes called Gauss’s Theorem after the great German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855), who discovered this theorem during his investigation of electrostatics. In Eastern Europe the Divergence Theorem is known as Ostrogradsky’s Theorem after the Russian mathematician Mikhail Ostrogradsky (1801–1862), who pub- lished this result in 1826. Thus the Divergence Theorem states that, under the given conditions, the lux of F across the boundary surface of E is equal to the triple integral of the divergence of F over E.

(See Figure 2.) SOLUTION It would be extremely dificult to evaluate the given surface integral directly. (We would have to evaluate four surface integrals corresponding to the four pieces of S.) Furthermore, the divergence of F is much less complicated than F itself: div F - - -x s xyd 1 - -y ( y 2 1 e x z 2 ) 1 - -z ssin xyd - y 1 2y - 3y Therefore we use the Divergence Theorem to transform the given surface integral into a triple integral. The easiest way to evaluate the triple integral is to express E as a type 3 region: E - h s x, y, zd | 21 < x < 1, 0 < z < 1 2 x 2 ,0 < y < 2 2 z j Then we have y S y F  dS - y y E y div F dV - y y E y 3y dV - 3 y 1 21 y 12x 2 0 y 22z 0 y dy dz dx - 3 y 1 21 y 12x 2 0 s2 2 zd 2 2 dz dx - 3 2 y 1 21 F 2 s2 2 zd 3 3 G 0 12x 2 dx - 2 1 2 y 1 21 fs x 2 1 1d 3 2 8g dx - 2 y 1 0 s x 6 1 3x 4 1 3x 2 2 7d dx - 184 35 ■ Notice that the method of proof of the Divergence Theorem is very similar to that of Green’s Theorem.

","1144 CHAPTER 16 Vector Calculus Although we have proved the Divergence Theorem only for simple solid regions, it can be proved for regions that are inite unions of simple solid regions. (The procedure is similar to the one we used in Section 16.4 to extend Green’s Theorem.) For example, let’s consider the region E that lies between the closed surfaces S 1 and S 2 , where S 1 lies inside S 2 . Let n 1 and n 2 be outward normals of S 1 and S 2 . Then the boundary surface of E is S - S 1 ø S 2 and its normal n is given by n - 2n 1 on S 1 and n - n 2 on S 2 . (See Figure 3.) Applying the Divergence Theorem to S, we get 7 y y E y div F dV - y S y F  dS - y S y F  n dS - y S1 y F  s2n 1 d dS 1 y S2 y F  n 2 dS - 2 y S1 y F  dS 1 y S2 y F  dS EXAMPLE 3 In Example 16.1.5 we considered the electric ield Esxd - «Q | x | 3 x where the electric charge Q is located at the origin and x - k x, y, z l is a position vector. Use the Divergence Theorem to show that the electric lux of E through any closed surface S 2 that encloses the origin is y S2 y E  dS - 4«Q SOLUTION The dificulty is that we don’t have an explicit equation for S 2 because it is any closed surface enclosing the origin. The simplest such surface would be a sphere, so we let S 1 be a small sphere with radius a and center the origin. You can verify that div E - 0. (See Exercise 23.) Therefore Equation 7 gives y S2 y E  dS - y S1 y E  dS 1 y y E y div E dV - y S1 y E  dS - y S1 y E  n dS The point of this calculation is that we can compute the surface integral over S 1 because S 1 is a sphere. The normal vector at x is xy | x | . Therefore E  n - «Q | x | 3 x  S x | x | D - «Q | x | 4 x  x - «Q | x | 2 - «Q a 2 since the equation of S 1 is | x | - a.

","SECTION 16.9 The Divergence Theorem 1145 Another application of the Divergence Theorem occurs in luid low. Let vs x, y, zd be the velocity ield of a luid with constant density . Then F - v is the rate of low per unit area. If P 0 s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d is a point in the luid and B a is a ball with center P 0 and very small radius a, then div FsPd< div FsP 0 d for all points P in B a since div F is con- tinuous. We approximate the lux over the boundary sphere S a as follows: y Sa y F  dS - y y Ba y div F dV < y y Ba y div FsP 0 d dV - div FsP 0 dVsB a d This approximation becomes better as a l 0 and suggests that 8 div FsP 0 d - lim a l 0 1 VsB a d y Sa y F  dS Equation 8 says that div FsP 0 d is the net rate of outward lux per unit volume at P 0 . (This is the reason for the name divergence.) If div FsPd . 0, the net low is outward near P and P is called a source. If div FsPd , 0, the net low is inward near P and P is called a sink. For the vector ield in Figure 4, it appears that the vectors that end near P 1 are shorter than the vectors that start near P 1 . Thus the net low is outward near P 1 , so div FsP 1 d . 0 and P 1 is a source. Near P 2 , on the other hand, the incoming arrows are longer than the outgoing arrows. Here the net low is inward, so div FsP 2 d , 0 and P 2 is a sink. We can use the formula for F to conirm this impression. Since F - x 2 i 1 y 2 j, we have div F - 2 x 1 2y, which is positive when y .2x. So the points above the line y - 2x are sources and those below are sinks.

A solid occupies a region E with surface S and is immersed in a liquid with constant density . We set up a coordinate system so that the xy-plane coincides with the surface of the liquid, and positive values of z are measured downward into the liquid. Then the pressure at depth z is p -  t z, where t is the acceleration due to gravity (see Section 8.3). The total buoyant force on the solid due to the pressure distribution is given by the surface integral F - 2 y S y pn dS where n is the outer unit normal. Use the result of Exercise 31 to show that F - 2W k, where W is the weight of the liquid displaced by the solid. (Note that F is directed upward because z is directed downward.)

Let S be a smooth parametric surface and let P be a point such that each line that starts at P intersects S at most once. The solid angle VsS d subtended by S at P is the set of lines starting at P and passing through S. Let Ssad be the intersection of VsS d with the surface of the sphere with center P and radius a.

The igure depicts the sequence of events in each cylinder of a four-cylinder internal combustion engine. Each piston moves up and down and is connected by a pivoted arm to a rotating crankshaft.

P V 0 C ! @ # $ % Intake Compression Explosion Exhaustion Flywheel Crankshaft Connecting rod Water During the intake stroke (from ① to ②) a mixture of air and gasoline at atmospheric pressure is drawn into a cylinder through the intake valve as the piston moves downward. Then the piston rapidly compresses the mix with the valves closed in the compression stroke (from ② to ③) during which the pressure rises and the volume decreases. At ③ the sparkplug ignites the fuel, raising the temperature and pressure at almost constant volume to ④. Then, with valves closed, the rapid expansion forces the piston downward during the power stroke (from ④ to ⑤). The exhaust valve opens, temperature and pressure drop, and mechanical energy stored in a rotating lywheel pushes the piston upward, forcing the waste products out of the exhaust valve in the exhaust stroke. The exhaust valve closes and the intake valve opens. We’re now back at ① and the cycle starts again.

","1154 CHAPTER 17 Second-Order Diferential Equations A second-order linear differential equation has the form 1 Ps xd d 2 y dx 2 1 Qs xd dy dx 1 Rs xd y - Gs xd where P, Q, R, and G are continuous functions. We saw in Section 9.1 that equations of this type arise in the study of the motion of a spring. In Section 17.3 we will further pursue this application as well as the application to electric circuits. In this section we study the case where Gs xd - 0, for all x, in Equation 1. Such equa- tions are called homogeneous linear equations. Thus the form of a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation is 2 Ps xd d 2 y dx 2 1 Qs xd dy dx 1 Rs xd y - 0 If Gs xd ± 0 for some x, Equation 1 is nonhomogeneous and is discussed in Section 17.2. Two basic facts enable us to solve homogeneous linear equations. The first of these says that if we know two solutions y 1 and y 2 of such an equation, then the linear combi- nation y - c 1 y 1 1 c 2 y 2 is also a solution. 3 Theorem If y 1 s xd and y 2 s xd are both solutions of the linear homogeneous equation (2) and c 1 and c 2 are any constants, then the function y s xd - c 1 y 1 s xd 1 c 2 y 2 s xd is also a solution of Equation 2. PROOF Since y 1 and y 2 are solutions of Equation 2, we have Ps xd y 0 1 1 Qs xd y 1 91 Rs xd y 1 - 0 and Ps xd y 2 01 Qs xd y 2 91 Rs xd y 2 - 0 Therefore, using the basic rules for differentiation, we have Ps xd y01 Qs xd y91 Rs xd y - Ps xdsc 1 y 1 1 c 2 y 2 d01 Qs xdsc 1 y 1 1 c 2 y 2 d91 Rs xdsc 1 y 1 1 c 2 y 2 d - Ps xdsc 1 y 1 01 c 2 y 2 0 d 1 Qs xdsc 1 y 1 91 c 2 y 2 9d 1 Rs xdsc 1 y 1 1 c 2 y 2 d - c 1 fPs xd y 1 01 Qs xd y 1 91 Rs xd y 1 g 1 c 2 fPs xd y 2 01 Qs xd y 2 91 Rs xd y 2 g - c 1 s0d 1 c 2 s0d - 0 Thus y - c 1 y 1 1 c 2 y 2 is a solution of Equation 2. ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 17.1 Second-Order Linear Equations 1155 The other fact we need is given by the following theorem, which is proved in more advanced courses. It says that the general solution is a linear combination of two linearly independent solutions y 1 and y 2 . This means that neither y 1 nor y 2 is a constant multiple of the other. For instance, the functions f s xd - x 2 and t s xd - 5x 2 are linearly dependent, but f s xd - e x and t s xd - xe x are linearly independent. 4 Theorem If y 1 and y 2 are linearly independent solutions of Equation 2 on an interval, and Ps xd is never 0, then the general solution is given by y s xd - c 1 y 1 s xd 1 c 2 y 2 s xd where c 1 and c 2 are arbitrary constants. Theorem 4 is very useful because it says that if we know two particular linearly inde- pendent solutions, then we know every solution. In general, it’s not easy to discover particular solutions to a second-order linear equa- tion. But it is always possible to do so if the coeficient functions P, Q, and R are constant functions, that is, if the differential equation has the form 5 ay 01 by91 cy - 0 where a, b, and c are constants and a ± 0. It’s not hard to think of some likely candidates for particular solutions of Equation 5 if we state the equation verbally. We are looking for a function y such that a constant times its second derivative y 0 plus another constant times y9 plus a third constant times y is equal to 0. We know that the exponential function y - e rx (where r is a constant) has the property that its derivative is a constant multiple of itself: y9 - re rx . Furthermore, y 0 - r 2 e rx . If we substitute these expressions into Equation 5, we see that y - e rx is a solution if ar 2 e rx 1 bre rx 1 ce rx - 0 or sar 2 1 br 1 cde rx - 0 But e rx is never 0. Thus y - e rx is a solution of Equation 5 if r is a root of the equation 6 ar 2 1 br 1 c - 0 Equation 6 is called the auxiliary equation (or characteristic equation) of the differen- tial equation ay 01 by91 cy - 0. Notice that it is an algebraic equation that is obtained from the differential equation by replacing y 0 by r 2 , y9 by r, and y by 1. Sometimes the roots r 1 and r 2 of the auxiliary equation can be found by factoring. In other cases they are found by using the quadratic formula: 7 r 1 - 2b 1 sb 2 2 4ac 2a r 2 - 2b 2 sb 2 2 4ac 2a We distinguish three cases according to the sign of the discriminant b 2 2 4ac.

(Note that e r 2 x is not a constant multiple of e r 1x .) Therefore, by Theorem 4, we have the following fact. 8 If the roots r 1 and r 2 of the auxiliary equation ar 2 1 br 1 c - 0 are real and unequal, then the general solution of ay 01 by91 cy - 0 is y - c 1 e r 1x 1 c 2 e r 2 x EXAMPLE 1 Solve the equation y 01 y92 6y - 0.

","SECTION 17.2 Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations 1161 is called the complementary equation and plays an important role in the solution of the original nonhomogeneous equation (1). 3 Theorem The general solution of the nonhomogeneous differential equa- tion (1) can be written as y s xd - y p s xd 1 y c s xd where y p is a particular solution of Equation 1 and y c is the general solution of the complementary Equation 2. PROOF We verify that if y is any solution of Equation 1, then y 2 y p is a solution of the complementary Equation 2. Indeed as y 2 y p d01 bs y 2 y p d91 c s y 2 y p d - ay 02 ay p 01 by92 by p 91 cy 2 cy p - say 01 by91 cyd 2 say p 01 by p 91 cy p d - Gs xd 2 Gs xd - 0 This shows that every solution is of the form ys xd - y p s xd 1 y c s xd. It is easy to check that every function of this form is a solution. ■ We know from Section 17.1 how to solve the complementary equation. (Recall that the solution is y c - c 1 y 1 1 c 2 y 2 , where y 1 and y 2 are linearly independent solutions of Equation 2.) Therefore Theorem 3 says that we know the general solution of the non- homogeneous equation as soon as we know a particular solution y p . There are two methods for inding a particular solution: The method of undetermined coeficients is straightfor- ward but works only for a restricted class of functions G. The method of variation of parameters works for every function G but is usually more dificult to apply in practice. The Method of Undetermined Coeicients We irst illustrate the method of undetermined coeficients for the equation ay 01 by91 cy - Gs xd where Gs x) is a polynomial. It is reasonable to guess that there is a particular solution y p that is a polynomial of the same degree as G because if y is a polynomial, then ay 01 by91 cy is also a polynomial. We therefore substitute y p s xd - a polynomial (of the same degree as G) into the differential equation and determine the coeficients. EXAMPLE 1 Solve the equation y 01 y92 2y - x 2 . SOLUTION The auxiliary equation of y 01 y92 2y - 0 is r 2 1 r 2 2 - sr 2 1dsr 1 2d - 0 with roots r - 1, 22. So the solution of the complementary equation is y c - c 1 e x 1 c 2 e 22 x Since Gs xd - x 2 is a polynomial of degree 2, we seek a particular solution of the form y p s xd - Ax 2 1 Bx 1 C Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

EXAMPLE 2 Solve y 01 4y - e 3 x .

In this section we explore two of them: the vibration of springs and electric circuits. Vibrating Springs We consider the motion of an object with mass m at the end of a spring that is either ver- tical (as in Figure 1) or horizontal on a level surface (as in Figure 2). In Section 6.4 we discussed Hooke’s Law, which says that if the spring is stretched (or compressed) x units from its natural length, then it exerts a force that is proportional to x: restoring force - 2kx where k is a positive constant (called the spring constant). If we ignore any external resisting forces (due to air resistance or friction) then, by Newton’s Second Law (force equals mass times acceleration), we have 1 m d 2 x dt 2 - 2kx or m d 2 x dt 2 1 kx - 0 This is a second-order linear differential equation. Its auxiliary equation is mr 2 1 k - 0 with roots r - 6i, where  - sky m . Thus the general solution is x std - c 1 cos t 1 c 2 sin t which can also be written as x std - A cosst 1 d where  - sky m (frequency) A - sc 1 2 1 c 2 2 (amplitude) cos  - c 1 A sin  - 2 c 2 A s is the phase angled (See Exercise 17.) This type of motion is called simple harmonic motion. x 0 x equilibrium position m m x 0 x m equilibrium position FIGURE 2 FIGURE 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 17.3 Applications of Second-Order Diferential Equations 1169 EXAMPLE 1 A spring with a mass of 2 kg has natural length 0.5 m. A force of 25.6 N is required to maintain it stretched to a length of 0.7 m. If the spring is stretched to a length of 0.7 m and then released with initial velocity 0, ind the position of the mass at any time t. SOLUTION From Hooke’s Law, the force required to stretch the spring is k s0.2d - 25.6 so k - 25.6y0.2 - 128. Using this value of the spring constant k, together with m - 2 in Equation 1, we have 2 d 2 x dt 2 1 128x - 0 As in the earlier general discussion, the solution of this equation is 2 x std - c 1 cos 8t 1 c 2 sin 8t We are given the initial condition that x s0d - 0.2. But, from Equation 2, x s0d - c 1 . Therefore c 1 - 0.2. Differentiating Equation 2, we get x9 std - 28c 1 sin 8t 1 8c 2 cos 8t Since the initial velocity is given as x9 s0d - 0, we have c 2 - 0 and so the solution is x std - 0.2 cos 8t ■ Damped Vibrations We next consider the motion of a spring that is subject to a frictional force (in the case of the horizontal spring of Figure 2) or a damping force (in the case where a vertical spring moves through a luid as in Figure 3). An example is the damping force supplied by a shock absorber in a car or a bicycle. We assume that the damping force is proportional to the velocity of the mass and acts in the direction opposite to the motion. (This has been conirmed, at least approximately, by some physical experiments.) Thus damping force - 2c dx dt where c is a positive constant, called the damping constant. Thus, in this case, Newton’s Second Law gives m d 2 x dt 2 - restoring force 1 damping force - 2kx 2 c dx dt or 3 m d 2 x dt 2 1 c dx dt 1 kx - 0 m FIGURE 3 Schwinn Cycling and Fitness Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1170 CHAPTER 17 Second-Order Diferential Equations Equation 3 is a second-order linear differential equation and its auxiliary equation is mr 2 1 cr 1 k - 0. The roots are 4 r 1 - 2c 1 sc 2 2 4mk 2m r 2 - 2c 2 sc 2 2 4mk 2m According to Section 17.1 we need to discuss three cases. CASE I c 2 2 4 mk . 0 (overdamping) In this case r 1 and r 2 are distinct real roots and x - c 1 e r 1 t 1 c 2 e r 2 t Since c, m, and k are all positive, we have sc 2 2 4mk , c, so the roots r 1 and r 2 given by Equations 4 must both be negative. This shows that x l 0 as t l `. Typical graphs of x as a function of t are shown in Figure 4. Notice that oscillations do not occur. (It’s possible for the mass to pass through the equilibrium position once, but only once.) This is because c 2 . 4mk means that there is a strong damping force (high-viscosity oil or grease) compared with a weak spring or small mass. CASE II c 2 2 4 mk - 0 (critical damping) This case corresponds to equal roots r 1 - r 2 - 2 c 2m and the solution is given by x - sc 1 1 c 2 tde 2scy2 mdt It is similar to Case I, and typical graphs resemble those in Figure 4 (see Exercise 12), but the damping is just suficient to suppress vibrations. Any decrease in the viscosity of the luid leads to the vibrations of the following case. CASE III c 2 2 4 mk , 0 (underdamping) Here the roots are complex: r 1 r 2 J - 2 c 2m 6 i where  - s4mk 2 c 2 2m The solution is given by x - e 2scy2mdt sc 1 cos t 1 c 2 sin td We see that there are oscillations that are damped by the factor e 2scy2 mdt . Since c . 0 and m . 0, we have 2sc y2md , 0 so e 2scy2 mdt l 0 as t l `. This implies that x l 0 as t l `; that is, the motion decays to 0 as time increases.

Find the position of the mass at any time t if it starts from the equilibrium position and is given a push to start it with an initial velocity of 0.6 mys. SOLUTION From Example 1, the mass is m - 2 and the spring constant is k - 128, so the differential equation (3) becomes 2 d 2 x dt 2 1 40 dx dt 1 128x - 0 or d 2 x dt 2 1 20 dx dt 1 64x - 0 The auxiliary equation is r 2 1 20r 1 64 - sr 1 4dsr 1 16d - 0 with roots 24 and 216, so the motion is overdamped and the solution is x std - c 1 e 24 t 1 c 2 e 216 t We are given that x s0d - 0, so c 1 1 c 2 - 0. Differentiating, we get x9 std - 24c 1 e 24 t 2 16c 2 e 216 t so x9 s0d - 24c 1 2 16c 2 - 0.6 Since c 2 - 2c 1 , this gives 12c 1 - 0.6 or c 1 - 0.05. Therefore x - 0.05se 24 t 2 e 216 t d ■ Forced Vibrations Suppose that, in addition to the restoring force and the damping force, the motion of the spring is affected by an external force Fstd. Then Newton’s Second Law gives m d 2 x dt 2 - restoring force 1 damping force 1 external force - 2kx 2 c dx dt 1 Fstd Thus, instead of the homogeneous equation (3), the motion of the spring is now governed by the following nonhomogeneous differential equation: 5 m d 2 x dt 2 1 c dx dt 1 kx - Fstd The motion of the spring can be determined by the methods of Section 17.2.

This is the phenomenon of resonance (see Exercise 10). Electric Circuits In Sections 9.3 and 9.5 we were able to use irst-order separable and linear equations to analyze electric circuits that contain a resistor and inductor (see Figure 9.3.5 or Fig- ure 9.5.4) or a resistor and capacitor (see Exercise 9.5.29). Now that we know how to solve second-order linear equations, we are in a position to analyze the circuit shown in Figure 7. It contains an electromotive force E (supplied by a battery or gen- erator), a resistor R, an inductor L, and a capacitor C, in series. If the charge on the capacitor at time t is Q - Qstd, then the current is the rate of change of Q with respect to t: I - dQy dt. As in Section 9.5, it is known from physics that the voltage drops across the resistor, inductor, and capacitor are RI L dI dt Q C respectively. Kirchhoff’s voltage law says that the sum of these voltage drops is equal to the supplied voltage: L dI dt 1 RI 1 Q C - Estd Since I - dQy dt, this equation becomes 7 L d 2 Q dt 2 1 R dQ dt 1 1 C Q - Estd which is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coeficients. If the charge Q 0 and the current I 0 are known at time 0, then we have the initial conditions Qs0d - Q 0 Q9 s0d - I s0d - I 0 and the initial-value problem can be solved by the methods of Section 17.2.

But now we could verify directly that the function given by Equation 8 is indeed a solution.

","A2 APPENDIX A Numbers, Inequalities, and Absolute Values Calculus is based on the real number system. We start with the integers: ..., 23, 22, 21, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... Then we construct the rational numbers, which are ratios of integers. Thus any rational number r can be expressed as r - m n where m and n are integers and n ± 0 Examples are 1 2 2 3 7 46 - 46 1 0.17 - 17 100 (Recall that division by 0 is always ruled out, so expressions like 3 0 and 0 0 are undeined.) Some real numbers, such as s2 , can’t be expressed as a ratio of integers and are there- fore called irrational numbers. It can be shown, with varying degrees of dificulty, that the following are also irrational numbers: s3 s5 s 3 2  sin 18 log 10 2 The set of all real numbers is usually denoted by the symbol R. When we use the word number without qualiication, we mean “real number.” Every number has a decimal representation. If the number is rational, then the cor- responding decimal is repeating. For example, 1 2 - 0.5000 . . . - 0.50 2 3 - 0.66666 . . . - 0.6 157 495 - 0.317171717 . . . - 0.317 9 7 - 1.285714285714 . . . - 1.285714 (The bar indicates that the sequence of digits repeats forever.) On the other hand, if the number is irrational, the decimal is nonrepeating: s2 - 1.414213562373095 . . .  - 3.141592653589793 . . . If we stop the decimal expansion of any number at a certain place, we get an approxima- tion to the number. For instance, we can write  < 3.14159265 where the symbol < is read “is approximately equal to.” The more decimal places we retain, the better the approximation we get. The real numbers can be represented by points on a line as in Figure 1. The positive direction (to the right) is indicated by an arrow. We choose an arbitrary reference point O, called the origin, which corresponds to the real number 0. Given any convenient unit of measurement, each positive number x is represented by the point on the line a distance of x units to the right of the origin, and each negative number 2x is represented by the point x units to the left of the origin. Thus every real number is represented by a point on the line, and every point P on the line corresponds to exactly one real number. The num- ber associated with the point P is called the coordinate of P and the line is then called a Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

We say a is less than b and write a , b if b 2 a is a positive number. Geometrically this means that a lies to the left of b on the number line. (Equivalently, we say b is greater than a and write b . a.) The symbol a < b (or b > a) means that either a , b or a - b and is read “a is less than or equal to b.” For instance, the following are true inequalities: 7 , 7.4 , 7.5 23 .2 s2 , 2 s2 < 2 2 < 2 In what follows we need to use set notation. A set is a collection of objects, and these objects are called the elements of the set. If S is a set, the notation a [ S means that a is an element of S, and a Ó S means that a is not an element of S. For example, if Z rep- resents the set of integers, then 23 [ Z but  Ó Z. If S and T are sets, then their union S ø T is the set consisting of all elements that are in S or T (or in both S and T ). The intersection of S and T is the set S > T consisting of all elements that are in both S and T. In other words, S > T is the common part of S and T. The empty set, denoted by ∅, is the set that contains no element. Some sets can be described by listing their elements between braces. For instance, the set A consisting of all positive integers less than 7 can be written as A - h1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6j We could also write A in set-builder notation as A - h x | x is an integer and 0 , x , 7j which is read “ A is the set of x such that x is an integer and 0 , x , 7.” Intervals Certain sets of real numbers, called intervals, occur frequently in calculus and corre- spond geometrically to line segments. For example, if a , b, the open interval from a to b consists of all numbers between a and b and is denoted by the symbol sa, bd. Using set-builder notation, we can write sa, bd - h x | a , x , bj Notice that the endpoints of the interval—namely, a and b—are excluded. This is indi- cated by the round brackets s d and by the open dots in Figure 2. The closed interval from a to b is the set fa, bg - h x | a < x < bj Here the endpoints of the interval are included. This is indicated by the square brackets f g and by the solid dots in Figure 3. It is also possible to include only one endpoint in an interval, as shown in Table 1.

The notation sa, `d stands for the set of all numbers that are greater than a, so the symbol ` simply indicates that the inter- val extends indefinitely far in the positive direction.

If a , b, then a 1 c , b 1 c. 2. If a , b and c , d, then a 1 c , b 1 d. 3. If a , b and c . 0, then ac , bc. 4. If a , b and c , 0, then ac . bc. 5. If 0 , a , b, then 1 ya . 1 yb. Rule 1 says that we can add any number to both sides of an inequality, and Rule 2 says that two inequalities can be added. However, we have to be careful with multiplication. Rule 3 says that we can multiply both sides of an inequality by a positive number, but Rule 4 says that if we multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, then we reverse the direction of the inequality. For example, if we take the inequality 3 , 5 and multiply by 2, we get 6 , 10, but if we multiply by 22, we get 26 .210. Finally, Rule 5 says that if we take reciprocals, then we reverse the direction of an inequality (provided the numbers are positive). EXAMPLE 1 Solve the inequality 1 1 x , 7x 1 5. SOLUTION The given inequality is satisfied by some values of x but not by others. To solve an inequality means to determine the set of numbers x for which the inequality is true. This is called the solution set. Table 1 lists the nine possible types of intervals. When these intervals are dis- cussed, it is always assumed that a , b. 1 Table of Intervals Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","APPENDIX A Numbers, Inequalities, and Absolute Values A5 First we subtract 1 from each side of the inequality (using Rule 1 with c - 21): x , 7x 1 4 Then we subtract 7x from both sides (Rule 1 with c - 27x): 26x , 4 Now we divide both sides by 26 (Rule 4 with c - 2 1 6 ): x .2 4 6 - 2 2 3 These steps can all be reversed, so the solution set consists of all numbers greater than 2 2 3 . In other words, the solution of the inequality is the interval (2 2 3 , `). ■ EXAMPLE 2 Solve the inequalities 4 < 3x 2 2 , 13. SOLUTION Here the solution set consists of all values of x that satisfy both inequalities. Using the rules given in (2), we see that the following inequalities are equivalent: 4 < 3x 2 2 , 13 6 < 3x , 15 (add 2) 2 < x , 5 (divide by 3) Therefore the solution set is f2, 5d. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Solve the inequality x 2 2 5x 1 6 < 0. SOLUTION First we factor the left side: s x 2 2ds x 2 3d < 0 We know that the corresponding equation s x 2 2ds x 2 3d - 0 has the solutions 2 and 3. The numbers 2 and 3 divide the real line into three intervals: s2`, 2d s2, 3d s3, `d On each of these intervals we determine the signs of the factors. For instance, x [ s2`, 2d ? x , 2 ? x 2 2 , 0 Then we record these signs in the following chart: Interval x 2 2 x 2 3 s x 2 2d s x 2 3d x , 2 2 2 1 2 , x , 3 1 2 2 x . 3 1 1 1 Another method for obtaining the information in the chart is to use test values. For instance, if we use the test value x - 1 for the interval s2`, 2d, then substitution in x 2 2 5x 1 6 gives 1 2 2 5s1d 1 6 - 2 FIGURE 4 x 0 y y=≈-5x+6 1 2 3 4 A visual method for solving Example 3 is to use a graphing device to graph the parabola y - x 2 2 5x 1 6 (as in Fig- ure 4) and observe that the curve lies on or below the x-axis when 2 < x < 3.

","A6 APPENDIX A Numbers, Inequalities, and Absolute Values The polynomial x 2 2 5x 1 6 doesn’t change sign inside any of the three intervals, so we conclude that it is positive on s2`, 2d. Then we read from the chart that s x 2 2ds x 2 3d is negative when 2 , x , 3. Thus the solution of the inequality s x 2 2ds x 2 3d < 0 is h x | 2 < x < 3j - f2, 3g Notice that we have included the endpoints 2 and 3 because we are looking for values of x such that the product is either negative or zero. The solution is illustrated in Figure 5. ■ EXAMPLE 4 Solve x 3 1 3x 2 . 4x.

On each interval the product keeps a constant sign, which we list in the following chart: Interval x x 2 1 x 1 4 x s x 2 1ds x 1 4d x ,24 2 2 2 2 24 , x , 0 2 2 1 1 0 , x , 1 1 2 1 2 x . 1 1 1 1 1 Then we read from the chart that the solution set is h x | 24 , x , 0 or x . 1j - s24, 0d ø s1, `d The solution is illustrated in Figure 6. ■ Absolute Value The absolute value of a number a, denoted by | a | , is the distance from a to 0 on the real number line. Distances are always positive or 0, so we have | a | > 0 for every number a For example, | 3 | - 3 | 23 | - 3 | 0 | - 0 | s2 2 1 | - s2 2 1 | 3 2  | -  2 3 In general, we have | a | - a if a > 0 | a | - 2a if a , 0 FIGURE 5 0 2 3 + - + x FIGURE 6 0 1 _4 Remember that if a is negative, then 2a is positive. 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Therefore the equation sa 2 - a is not always true. It is true only when a > 0. If a , 0, then 2a . 0, so we have sa 2 - 2a. In view of (3), we then have the equation sa 2 - | a | which is true for all values of a. Hints for the proofs of the following properties are given in the exercises. 5 Properties of Absolute Values Suppose a and b are any real numbers and n is an integer. Then 1. | ab | - | a || b | 2.

If a and b are any real numbers, then the distance between a and b is the absolute value of the difference, namely, | a 2 b | , which is also equal to | b 2 a | . (See Figure 8.) EXAMPLE 6 Solve | 2x 2 5 | - 3. SOLUTION By Property 4 of (6), | 2x 2 5 | - 3 is equivalent to 2x 2 5 - 3 or 2x 2 5 - 23 So 2x - 8 or 2x - 2.

But if a and b have opposite signs, the left side involves a subtraction and the right side does not. This makes the Triangle Inequality seem reasonable, but we can prove it as follows. Notice that 2 | a | < a < | a | is always true because a equals either | a | or 2 | a | . The corresponding statement for b is 2 | b | < b < | b | Adding these inequalities, we get 2s | a | 1 | b | d < a 1 b < | a | 1 | b | If we now apply Properties 4 and 5 (with x replaced by a 1 b and a by | a | 1 | b | ), we obtain | a 1 b | < | a | 1 | b | which is what we wanted to show. 3 5 7 2 2 FIGURE 9 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","A10 APPENDIX A Numbers, Inequalities, and Absolute Values Just as the points on a line can be identiied with real numbers by assigning them coordi- nates, as described in Appendix A, so the points in a plane can be identiied with ordered pairs of real numbers. We start by drawing two perpendicular coordinate lines that inter- sect at the origin O on each line. Usually one line is horizontal with positive direction to the right and is called the x-axis; the other line is vertical with positive direction upward and is called the y-axis. Any point P in the plane can be located by a unique ordered pair of numbers as fol- lows. Draw lines through P perpendicular to the x- and y-axes. These lines intersect the axes in points with coordinates a and b as shown in Figure 1. Then the point P is assigned the ordered pair sa, bd. The irst number a is called the x-coordinate of P; the second number b is called the y-coordinate of P. We say that P is the point with coordinates sa, bd, and we denote the point by the symbol Psa, bd.

The plane supplied with this coordinate system is called the coordinate plane or the Cartesian plane and is denoted by R 2 . The x- and y-axes are called the coordinate axes and divide the Cartesian plane into four quadrants, which are labeled I, II, III, and IV in Figure 1. Notice that the irst quad- rant consists of those points whose x- and y-coordinates are both positive. EXAMPLE 1 Describe and sketch the regions given by the following sets. (a) hs x, yd | x > 0j (b) hs x, yd | y - 1j (c) hs x, yd | | y | , 1j SOLUTION (a) The points whose x-coordinates are 0 or positive lie on the y-axis or to the right of it as indicated by the shaded region in Figure 3(a). x 0 y x 0 y y=1 x 0 y y=1 y=_1 (a) x  0 (b) y=1 (c) | y |<1 (b) The set of all points with y-coordinate 1 is a horizontal line one unit above the x-axis [see Figure 3(b)].

[These lines are shown as dashed lines in Figure 3(c) to indicate that the points on these lines don’t lie in the set.] ■ Recall from Appendix A that the distance between points a and b on a number line is | a 2 b | - | b 2 a | . Thus the distance between points P 1 s x 1 , y 1 d and P 3 s x 2 , y 1 d on a horizontal line must be | x 2 2 x 1 | and the distance between P 2 s x 2 , y 2 d and P 3 s x 2 , y 1 d on a vertical line must be | y 2 2 y 1 | .

To ind the equation of L we use its slope, which is a measure of the steepness of the line. 2 Deinition The slope of a nonvertical line that passes through the points P 1 s x 1 , y 1 d and P 2 s x 2 , y 2 d is m - Dy Dx - y 2 2 y 1 x 2 2 x 1 The slope of a vertical line is not deined. Thus the slope of a line is the ratio of the change in y, Dy, to the change in x, Dx. (See Figure 5.) The slope is therefore the rate of change of y with respect to x. The fact that the line is straight means that the rate of change is constant. Figure 6 shows several lines labeled with their slopes. Notice that lines with positive slope slant upward to the right, whereas lines with negative slope slant downward to the right. Notice also that the steepest lines are the ones for which the absolute value of the slope is largest, and a horizontal line has slope 0. Now let’s ind an equation of the line that passes through a given point P 1 s x 1 , y 1 d and has slope m. A point Ps x, yd with x ± x 1 lies on this line if and only if the slope of the line through P 1 and P is equal to m; that is, y 2 y 1 x 2 x 1 - m This equation can be rewritten in the form y 2 y 1 - ms x 2 x 1 d and we observe that this equation is also satisfied when x - x 1 and y - y 1 . Therefore it is an equation of the given line. 3 Point-Slope Form of the Equation of a Line An equation of the line passing through the point P 1 s x 1 , y 1 d and having slope m is y 2 y 1 - ms x 2 x 1 d FIGURE 5 P™(x™, y™) P¡(x¡, y¡) L Îy=fi-› =rise Îx=¤-/ =run x 0 y x 0 y m=1 m=0 m=_1 m=_2 m=_5 m=2 m=5 m= 1 2 m=_ 1 2 FIGURE 6 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","APPENDIX B Coordinate Geometry and Lines A13 EXAMPLE 3 Find an equation of the line through s1, 27d with slope 2 1 2 . SOLUTION Using (3) with m - 2 1 2 , x 1 - 1, and y 1 - 27, we obtain an equation of the line as y 1 7 - 2 1 2 s x 2 1d which we can rewrite as 2y 1 14 - 2x 1 1 or x 1 2y 1 13 - 0 ■ EXAMPLE 4 Find an equation of the line through the points s21, 2d and s3, 24d. SOLUTION By Deinition 2 the slope of the line is m - 24 2 2 3 2 s21d - 2 3 2 Using the point-slope form with x 1 - 21 and y 1 - 2, we obtain y 2 2 - 2 3 2 s x 1 1d which simpliies to 3x 1 2y - 1 ■ Suppose a nonvertical line has slope m and y-intercept b. (See Figure 7.) This means it intersects the y-axis at the point s0, bd, so the point-slope form of the equation of the line, with x 1 - 0 and y 1 - b, becomes y 2 b - ms x 2 0d This simpliies as follows. 4 Slope-Intercept Form of the Equation of a Line An equation of the line with slope m and y-intercept b is y - mx 1 b In particular, if a line is horizontal, its slope is m - 0, so its equation is y - b, where b is the y-intercept (see Figure 8). A vertical line does not have a slope, but we can write its equation as x - a, where a is the x-intercept, because the x-coordinate of every point on the line is a. Observe that the equation of every line can be written in the form Ax 1 By 1 C - 0 5 because a vertical line has the equation x - a or x 2 a - 0 ( A - 1, B - 0, C - 2ad and a nonvertical line has the equation y - mx 1 b or 2mx 1 y 2 b - 0 ( A - 2m, B - 1, C - 2b). Conversely, if we start with a general irst-degree equation, that is, an equation of the form (5), where A, B, and C are constants and A and B are not both 0, then we can show that it is the equation of a line. If B - 0, the equation becomes Ax 1 C - 0 or x - 2C yA , which represents a vertical line with x-intercept 2C yA .

","A14 APPENDIX B Coordinate Geometry and Lines equation can be rewritten by solving for y: y - 2 A B x 2 C B and we recognize this as being the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line (m - 2A yB, b - 2C yB). Therefore an equation of the form (5) is called a linear equation or the general equation of a line. For brevity, we often refer to “the line Ax 1 By 1 C - 0 ” instead of “the line whose equation is Ax 1 By 1 C - 0.” EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the equation 3x 2 5y - 15. SOLUTION Since the equation is linear, its graph is a line. To draw the graph, we can simply ind two points on the line. It’s easiest to ind the intercepts. Substituting y - 0 (the equation of the x-axis) in the given equation, we get 3x - 15, so x - 5 is the x-intercept. Substituting x - 0 in the equation, we see that the y-intercept is 23. This allows us to sketch the graph as in Figure 9. ■ EXAMPLE 6 Graph the inequality x 1 2y . 5. SOLUTION We are asked to sketch the graph of the set hs x, yd | x 1 2y . 5j and we begin by solving the inequality for y: x 1 2y . 5 2y .2x 1 5 y .2 1 2 x 1 5 2 Compare this inequality with the equation y - 2 1 2 x 1 5 2 , which represents a line with slope 2 1 2 and y-intercept 5 2 . We see that the given graph consists of points whose y-coordinates are larger than those on the line y - 2 1 2 x 1 5 2 . Thus the graph is the region that lies above the line, as illustrated in Figure 10. ■ Parallel and Perpendicular Lines Slopes can be used to show that lines are parallel or perpendicular. The following facts are proved, for instance, in Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus, Seventh Edition, by Stewart, Redlin, and Watson (Belmont, CA, 2016). 6 Parallel and Perpendicular Lines 1.

","A16 APPENDIX B Coordinate Geometry and Lines In Appendix B we saw that a irst-degree, or linear, equation Ax 1 By 1 C - 0 repre- sents a line. In this section we discuss second-degree equations such as x 2 1 y 2 - 1 y - x 2 1 1 x 2 9 1 y 2 4 - 1 x 2 2 y 2 - 1 which represent a circle, a parabola, an ellipse, and a hyperbola, respectively. The graph of such an equation in x and y is the set of all points s x, yd that satisfy the equation; it gives a visual representation of the equation. Conversely, given a curve in the xy-plane, we may have to ind an equation that represents it, that is, an equation satisied by the coordinates of the points on the curve and by no other point. This is the other half of the basic principle of analytic geometry as formulated by Descartes and Fermat. The idea is that if a geometric curve can be represented by an algebraic equation, then the rules of algebra can be used to analyze the geometric problem. Circles As an example of this type of problem, let’s ind an equation of the circle with radius r and center sh, kd. By deinition, the circle is the set of all points Ps x, yd whose distance 57.

From the distance formula, we have ss x 2 hd 2 1 s y 2 kd 2 - r or equivalently, squaring both sides, we get s x 2 hd 2 1 s y 2 kd 2 - r 2 This is the desired equation. 1 Equation of a Circle An equation of the circle with center sh, kd and radius r is s x 2 hd 2 1 s y 2 kd 2 - r 2 In particular, if the center is the origin s0, 0d, the equation is x 2 1 y 2 - r 2 EXAMPLE 1 Find an equation of the circle with radius 3 and center s2, 25d.

","A18 APPENDIX C Graphs of Second-Degree Equations Parabolas The geometric properties of parabolas are reviewed in Section 10.5. Here we regard a parabola as a graph of an equation of the form y - ax 2 1 bx 1 c. EXAMPLE 3 Draw the graph of the parabola y - x 2 . SOLUTION We set up a table of values, plot points, and join them by a smooth curve to obtain the graph in Figure 3. x y - x 2 0 0 6 1 2 1 4 61 1 62 4 63 9 0 y 1 x 1 y=≈ FIGURE 3 ■ Figure 4 shows the graphs of several parabolas with equations of the form y - ax 2 for various values of the number a. In each case the vertex, the point where the parabola changes direction, is the origin. We see that the parabola y - ax 2 opens upward if a . 0 and downward if a , 0 (as in Figure 5). x 0 y (_x, y) (x, y) x 0 y (a) y=a≈, a>0 (b) y=a≈, a<0 y x y=2≈ y=≈ y=_≈ y=_2≈ y= ≈ 1 2 y=_ ≈ 1 2 Notice that if s x, yd satisies y - ax 2 , then so does s2x, yd. This corresponds to the geometric fact that if the right half of the graph is relected about the y-axis, then the left half of the graph is obtained. We say that the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. The graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the y-axis if the equation is unchanged when x is replaced by 2x. If we interchange x and y in the equation y - ax 2 , the result is x - ay 2 , which also rep- resents a parabola. (Interchanging x and y amounts to relecting about the diagonal line y - x.) The parabola x - ay 2 opens to the right if a . 0 and to the left if a , 0. (See FIGURE 4 FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the region bounded by the parabola x - y 2 and the line y - x 2 2. SOLUTION First we ind the points of intersection by solving the two equations. Substi- tuting x - y 1 2 into the equation x - y 2 , we get y 1 2 - y 2 , which gives 0 - y 2 2 y 2 2 - s y 2 2ds y 1 1d so y - 2 or 21. Thus the points of intersection are s4, 2d and s1, 21d, and we draw the line y - x 2 2 passing through these points. We then sketch the parabola x - y 2 by referring to Figure 6(a) and having the parabola pass through s4, 2d and s1, 21d. The region bounded by x - y 2 and y - x 2 2 means the inite region whose boundaries are these curves. It is sketched in Figure 7. ■ Ellipses The curve with equation x 2 a 2 1 y 2 b 2 - 1 2 where a and b are positive numbers, is called an ellipse in standard position. (Geometric properties of ellipses are discussed in Section 10.5.) Observe that Equation 2 is unchanged if x is replaced by 2x or y is replaced by 2y, so the ellipse is symmetric with respect to both axes. As a further aid to sketching the ellipse, we ind its intercepts. The x-intercepts of a graph are the x-coordinates of the points where the graph intersects the x-axis. They are found by setting y - 0 in the equation of the graph. The y-intercepts are the y-coordinates of the points where the graph intersects the y-axis. They are found by setting x - 0 in its equation. If we set y - 0 in Equation 2, we get x 2 - a 2 and so the x-intercepts are 6a . Setting x - 0, we get y 2 - b 2 , so the y-intercepts are 6b. Using this information, together with symmetry, we sketch the ellipse in Figure 8. If a - b, the ellipse is a circle with radius a.

","A20 APPENDIX C Graphs of Second-Degree Equations EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of 9x 2 1 16y 2 - 144. SOLUTION We divide both sides of the equation by 144: x 2 16 1 y 2 9 - 1 The equation is now in the standard form for an ellipse (2), so we have a 2 - 16, b 2 - 9, a - 4, and b - 3. The x-intercepts are 64; the y-intercepts are 63. The graph is sketched in Figure 9. 0 x y (0, 3) (4, 0) (_4, 0) (0, _3) ■ Hyperbolas The curve with equation 3 x 2 a 2 2 y 2 b 2 - 1 is called a hyperbola in standard position. Again, Equation 3 is unchanged when x is replaced by 2x or y is replaced by 2y, so the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes. To ind the x-intercepts we set y - 0 and obtain x 2 - a 2 and x - 6a. How- ever, if we put x - 0 in Equation 3, we get y 2 - 2b 2 , which is impossible, so there is no y-intercept. In fact, from Equation 3 we obtain x 2 a 2 - 1 1 y 2 b 2 > 1 which shows that x 2 > a 2 and so | x | - sx 2 > a. Therefore we have x > a or x <2a. This means that the hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches. It is sketched in Figure 10. In drawing a hyperbola it is useful to draw irst its asymptotes, which are the lines y - sb yad x and y - 2sb yad x shown in Figure 10. Both branches of the hyperbola approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the asymptotes. This involves the idea of a limit, which is discussed in Chapter 2. (See also Exercise 4.5.73.) By interchanging the roles of x and y we get an equation of the form y 2 a 2 2 x 2 b 2 - 1 which also represents a hyperbola and is sketched in Figure 11.

","APPENDIX C Graphs of Second-Degree Equations A21 EXAMPLE 6 Sketch the curve 9x 2 2 4y 2 - 36. SOLUTION Dividing both sides by 36, we obtain x 2 4 2 y 2 9 - 1 which is the standard form of the equation of a hyperbola (Equation 3). Since a 2 - 4, the x-intercepts are 62. Since b 2 - 9, we have b - 3 and the asymptotes are y - 6 3 2 x.

Its asymptotes are y - 6x, which are perpendi- cular. If an equilateral hyperbola is rotated by 458, the asymptotes become the x- and y-axes, and it can be shown that the new equation of the hyperbola is xy - k, where k is a constant [see Figure 13(b)].

Then we define 5 sin  - y r csc  - r y cos  - x r sec  - r x tan  - y x cot  - x y Since division by 0 is not defined, tan  and sec  are undefined when x - 0 and csc  and cot  are undefined when y - 0. Notice that the definitions in (4) and (5) are consis- tent when  is an acute angle. If  is a number, the convention is that sin  means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is . For example, the expression sin 3 implies that we are dealing with an angle of 3 rad. When finding a calculator approximation to this number, we must remember to set our calculator in radian mode, and then we obtain sin 3 < 0.14112 If we want to know the sine of the angle 38 we would write sin 38 and, with our calculator in degree mode, we find that sin 38 < 0.05234 The exact trigonometric ratios for certain angles can be read from the triangles in Figure 9.

Section 2.5 PROOF First we show that if f is both one-to-one and continuous on sa, bd, then it must be either increasing or decreasing on sa, bd. If it were neither increasing nor decreas- ing, then there would exist numbers x 1 , x 2 , and x 3 in sa, bd with x 1 , x 2 , x 3 such that f s x 2 d does not lie between f s x 1 d and f s x 3 d. There are two possibilities: either (1) f s x 3 d lies between f s x 1 d and f s x 2 d or (2) f s x 1 d lies between f s x 2 d and f s x 3 d. (Draw a pic- ture.) In case (1) we apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to the continuous function f to get a number c between x 1 and x 2 such that f scd - f s x 3 d. In case (2) the Intermedi- ate Value Theorem gives a number c between x 2 and x 3 such that f scd - f s x 1 d. In either case we have contradicted the fact that f is one-to-one. Let us assume, for the sake of deiniteness, that f is increasing on sa, bd. We take any number y 0 in the domain of f 21 and we let f 21 s y 0 d - x 0 ; that is, x 0 is the number in sa, bd such that f s x 0 d - y 0 . To show that f 21 is continuous at y 0 we take any «. 0 such that the interval s x 0 2«, x 0 1«d is contained in the interval sa, bd. Since f is increasing, it maps the numbers in the interval s x 0 2«, x 0 1«d onto the numbers in the interval s f s x 0 2«d, f s x 0 1«dd and f 21 reverses the correspondence. If we let  denote the smaller of the numbers  1 - y 0 2 f s x 0 2«d and  2 - f s x 0 1«d 2 y 0 , then the interval s y 0 2 , y 0 1 d is contained in the interval s f s x 0 2«d, f s x 0 1«dd and so is Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","A44 APPENDIX F Proofs of Theorems We approximate the arc AB by an inscribed polygon consisting of n equal line seg- ments and we look at a typical segment PQ.

Therefore we have | PQ | , | RT | , | RS | If we add n such inequalities, we get L n , | AD | - tan  where L n is the length of the inscribed polygon. Thus, by Theorem 2.3.2, we have lim nl` L n < tan  But the arc length is deined in Equation 8.1.1 as the limit of the lengths of inscribed polygons, so  - lim n l` L n < tan  ■ Concavity Test (a) If f 0s xd . 0 for all x in I , then the graph of f is concave upward on I. (b) If f 0s xd , 0 for all x in I , then the graph of f is concave downward on I. Section 4.3 PROOF OF (a) Let a be any number in I. We must show that the curve y - f s xd lies above the tangent line at the point sa, f sadd. The equation of this tangent is y - f sad 1 f 9 sads x 2 ad So we must show that f s xd . f sad 1 f 9 sads x 2 ad whenever x [ I s x ± ad. (See Figure 3.) First let us take the case where x . a.

So this inequality becomes 3 f s xd . f sad 1 f 9 sads x 2 ad which is what we wanted to prove. For the case where x , a we have f 9 scd , f 9 sad, but multiplication by the negative number x 2 a reverses the inequality, so we get (2) and (3) as before. ■ In order to give the promised proof of l’Hospital’s Rule, we irst need a generalization of the Mean Value Theorem. The following theorem is named after another French math- ematician, Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857). 1 Cauchy’s Mean Value Theorem Suppose that the functions f and t are con- tinuous on fa, bg and differentiable on sa, bd, and t9 s xd ± 0 for all x in sa, bd. Then there is a number c in sa, bd such that f 9 scd t9 scd - f sbd 2 f sad tsbd 2 tsad See the biographical sketch of Cauchy on page 109. Notice that if we take the special case in which ts xd - x, then t9 scd - 1 and Theo- rem 1 is just the ordinary Mean Value Theorem. Furthermore, Theorem 1 can be proved in a similar manner. You can verify that all we have to do is change the function h given by Equation 4.2.4 to the function hs xd - f s xd 2 f sad 2 f sbd 2 f sad tsbd 2 tsad f ts xd 2 tsadg and apply Rolle’s Theorem as before. L’Hospital’s Rule Suppose f and t are differentiable and t9 s xd ± 0 on an open interval I that contains a (except possibly at a). Suppose that lim x l a f s xd - 0 and lim x l a ts xd - 0 or that lim x l a f s xd - 6` and lim x l a ts xd - 6` (In other words, we have an indeterminate form of type 0 0 or ` y`.) Then lim x l a f s xd ts xd - lim x l a f 9 s xd t9 s xd if the limit on the right side exists (or is ` or 2`). Section 4.4 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Let x [ I and x . a. Then F and G are continuous on fa, xg and differentiable on sa, xd and G9 ± 0 there (since F9 - f 9 and G9 - t9).

Theorem 1. If a power series o c n x n converges when x - b (where b ± 0), then it converges whenever | x | , | b | . 2. If a power series o c n x n diverges when x - d (where d ± 0), then it diverges whenever | x | . | d | . Section 11.8 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","APPENDIX F Proofs of Theorems A47 PROOF OF 1 Suppose that o c n b n converges. Then, by Theorem 11.2.6, we have lim n l ` c n b n - 0. According to Deinition 11.1.2 with « - 1, there is a positive integer N such that | c n b n | , 1 whenever n > N. Thus, for n > N, we have | c n x n | - Z c n b n x n b n Z - | c n b n | Z x b Z n , Z x b Z n If | x | , | b | , then | x yb | , 1, so o | x yb | n is a convergent geometric series. Therefore, by the Comparison Test, the series o ` n-N | c n x n | is convergent. Thus the series o c n x n is absolutely convergent and therefore convergent. ■ PROOF OF 2 Suppose that o c n d n diverges. If x is any number such that | x | . | d | , then o c n x n cannot converge because, by part 1, the convergence of o c n x n would imply the convergence of o c n d n . Therefore o c n x n diverges whenever | x | . | d | . ■ Theorem For a power series o c n x n there are only three possibilities: 1. The series converges only when x - 0. 2. The series converges for all x. 3. There is a positive number R such that the series converges if | x | , R and diverges if | x | . R. PROOF Suppose that neither case 1 nor case 2 is true. Then there are nonzero numbers b and d such that o c n x n converges for x - b and diverges for x - d. Therefore the set S - h x | o c n x n convergesj is not empty. By the preceding theorem, the series diverges if | x | . | d | , so | x | < | d | for all x [ S. This says that | d | is an upper bound for the set S. Thus, by the Completeness Axiom (see Section 11.1), S has a least upper bound R. If | x | . R, then x Ó S, so o c n x n diverges. If | x | , R, then | x | is not an upper bound for S and so there exists b [ S such that b . | x | . Since b [ S, o c n x n con- verges, so by the preceding theorem o c n x n converges. ■ 4 Theorem For a power series o c n s x 2 ad n there are only three possibilities: 1. The series converges only when x - a. 2. The series converges for all x. 3. There is a positive number R such that the series converges if | x 2 a | , R and diverges if | x 2 a | . R. PROOF If we make the change of variable u - x 2 a, then the power series becomes o c n u n and we can apply the preceding theorem to this series. In case 3 we have con- vergence for | u | , R and divergence for | u | . R. Thus we have convergence for | x 2 a | , R and divergence for | x 2 a | . R. ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","A50 APPENDIX G The Logarithm Deined as an Integral Our treatment of exponential and logarithmic functions until now has relied on our intu- ition, which is based on numerical and visual evidence. (See Sections 1.4, 1.5, and 3.1.) Here we use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to give an alternative treatment that provides a surer footing for these functions. Instead of starting with b x and deining log b x as its inverse, this time we start by dein- ing ln x as an integral and then deine the exponential function as its inverse. You should bear in mind that we do not use any of our previous deinitions and results concerning exponential and logarithmic functions. The Natural Logarithm We irst deine ln x as an integral. 1 Deinition The natural logarithmic function is the function deined by ln x - y x 1 1 t dt x . 0 The existence of this function depends on the fact that the integral of a continuous function always exists. If x . 1, then ln x can be interpreted geometrically as the area under the hyperbola y - 1 yt from t - 1 to t - x. (See Figure 1.) For x - 1, we have ln 1 - y 1 1 1 t dt - 0 For 0 , x , 1, ln x - y x 1 1 t dt - 2 y 1 x 1 t dt , 0 and so ln x is the negative of the area shown in Figure 2. EXAMPLE 1 (a) By comparing areas, show that 1 2 , ln 2 , 3 4 . (b) Use the Midpoint Rule with n - 10 to estimate the value of ln 2. SOLUTION (a) We can interpret ln 2 as the area under the curve y - 1 yt from 1 to 2. From Fig- ure 3 we see that this area is larger than the area of rectangle BCDE and smaller than the area of trapezoid ABCD. Thus we have 1 2 ? 1 , ln 2 , 1 ? 1 2 s1 1 1 2 d 1 2 , ln 2 , 3 4 (b) If we use the Midpoint Rule with f std - 1 yt, n - 10, and Dt - 0.1, we get ln 2 - y 2 1 1 t dt <s0.1df f s1.05d 1 f s1.15d 1 ∙∙∙ 1 f s1.95dg - s0.1d S 1 1.05 1 1 1.15 1 ∙∙∙ 1 1 1.95 D < 0.693 ■ y= 1 t 0 y 1 x t area=ln x y= 1 t 0 y 1 x t area=_ ln x y= 1 t 0 y 1 2 t A B C D E FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 FIGURE 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","APPENDIX G The Logarithm Deined as an Integral A51 Notice that the integral that deines ln x is exactly the type of integral discussed in Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (see Section 5.3). In fact, using that theorem, we have d dx y x 1 1 t dt - 1 x and so 2 d dx sln xd - 1 x We now use this differentiation rule to prove the following properties of the logarithm function. 3 Laws of Logarithms If x and y are positive numbers and r is a rational num- ber, then 1. lns xyd - ln x 1 ln y 2. ln S x y D - ln x 2 ln y 3. lns x r d - r ln x PROOF 1. Let f s xd - lnsaxd, where a is a positive constant. Then, using Equation 2 and the Chain Rule, we have f 9 s xd - 1 ax d dx saxd - 1 ax ? a - 1 x Therefore f s xd and ln x have the same derivative and so they must differ by a constant: lnsaxd - ln x 1 C Putting x - 1 in this equation, we get ln a - ln 1 1 C - 0 1 C - C. Thus lnsaxd - ln x 1 ln a If we now replace the constant a by any number y, we have lns xyd - ln x 1 ln y 2. Using Law 1 with x - 1 yy, we have ln 1 y 1 ln y - ln S 1 y ? y D - ln 1 - 0 and so ln 1 y - 2ln y Using Law 1 again, we have ln S x y D - ln S x ? 1 y D - ln x 1 ln 1 y - ln x 2 ln y The proof of Law 3 is left as an exercise. ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Now ln 2 . 0, so this shows that lns2 n d l ` as n l `. But ln x is an increasing function since its derivative 1 yx . 0. Therefore ln x l ` as x l `. (b) If we let t - 1 yx, then t l ` as x l 0 1 .

Putting this infor- mation together with (4), we draw the graph of y - ln x in Figure 4. Since ln 1 - 0 and ln x is an increasing continuous function that takes on arbitrarily large values, the Intermediate Value Theorem shows that there is a number where ln x takes on the value 1. (See Figure 5.) This important number is denoted by e. 5 Deinition e is the number such that ln e - 1. We will show (in Theorem 19) that this deinition is consistent with our previous dei- nition of e. The Natural Exponential Function Since ln is an increasing function, it is one-to-one and therefore has an inverse function, which we denote by exp.

(See Figure 6.) The domain of exp is the range of ln, that is, s2`, `d; the range of exp is the domain of ln, that is, s0, `d. If r is any rational number, then the third law of logarithms gives lnse r d - r ln e - r Therefore, by (6), expsrd - e r Thus exps xd - e x whenever x is a rational number. This leads us to deine e x , even for irrational values of x, by the equation e x - exps xd In other words, for the reasons given, we deine e x to be the inverse of the function ln x.

","APPENDIX H Complex Numbers A57 A complex number can be represented by an expression of the form a 1 bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is a symbol with the property that i 2 - 21. The complex number a 1 bi can also be represented by the ordered pair sa, bd and plotted as a point in a plane (called the Argand plane) as in Figure 1. Thus the complex number i - 0 1 1 ? i is identiied with the point s0, 1d. The real part of the complex number a 1 bi is the real number a and the imaginary part is the real number b. Thus the real part of 4 2 3i is 4 and the imaginary part is 23. Two complex numbers a 1 bi and c 1 di are equal if a - c and b - d, that is, their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. In the Argand plane the horizontal axis is called the real axis and the vertical axis is called the imaginary axis. The sum and difference of two complex numbers are deined by adding or subtracting their real parts and their imaginary parts: sa 1 bi d 1 sc 1 di d - sa 1 cd 1 sb 1 d di sa 1 bi d 2 sc 1 di d - sa 2 cd 1 sb 2 d di For instance, s1 2 i d 1 s4 1 7i d - s1 1 4d 1 s21 1 7di - 5 1 6i The product of complex numbers is deined so that the usual commutative and distribu- tive laws hold: sa 1 bi dsc 1 di d - asc 1 di d 1 sbi dsc 1 di d - ac 1 adi 1 bci 1 bdi 2 Since i 2 - 21, this becomes sa 1 bi dsc 1 di d - sac 2 bd d 1 sad 1 bcdi EXAMPLE 1 s21 1 3i ds2 2 5i d - s21ds2 2 5i d 1 3is2 2 5i d - 22 1 5i 1 6i 2 15s21d - 13 1 11i ■ Division of complex numbers is much like rationalizing the denominator of a rational expression. For the complex number z - a 1 bi, we deine its complex conjugate to be z - a 2 bi. To ind the quotient of two complex numbers we multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. EXAMPLE 2 Express the number 21 1 3i 2 1 5i in the form a 1 bi.

","A58 APPENDIX H Complex Numbers SOLUTION We multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 2 1 5i, namely, 2 2 5i, and we take advantage of the result of Example 1: 21 1 3i 2 1 5i - 21 1 3i 2 1 5i ? 2 2 5i 2 2 5i - 13 1 11i 2 2 1 5 2 - 13 29 1 11 29 i ■ The geometric interpretation of the complex conjugate is shown in Figure 2: z is the relection of z in the real axis. We list some of the properties of the complex conjugate in the following box. The proofs follow from the deinition and are requested in Exer- cise 18. Properties of Conjugates z 1 w - z 1 w zw - z w z n - z n The modulus, or absolute value, | z | of a complex number z - a 1 bi is its distance from the origin. From Figure 3 we see that if z - a 1 bi, then | z | - sa 2 1 b 2 Notice that zz - sa 1 bi dsa 2 bi d - a 2 1 abi 2 abi 2 b 2 i 2 - a 2 1 b 2 and so zz - | z | 2 This explains why the division procedure in Example 2 works in general: z w - z w ww - z w | w | 2 Since i 2 - 21, we can think of i as a square root of 21. But notice that we also have s2i d 2 - i 2 - 21 and so 2i is also a square root of 21. We say that i is the principal square root of 21 and write s21 - i. In general, if c is any positive number, we write s2c - sc i With this convention, the usual derivation and formula for the roots of the quadratic equa- tion ax 2 1 bx 1 c - 0 are valid even when b 2 2 4ac , 0: x - 2b 6 sb 2 2 4ac 2a EXAMPLE 3 Find the roots of the equation x 2 1 x 1 1 - 0.

","APPENDIX H Complex Numbers A59 We observe that the solutions of the equation in Example 3 are complex conjugates of each other. In general, the solutions of any quadratic equation ax 2 1 bx 1 c - 0 with real coeficients a, b, and c are always complex conjugates. (If z is real, z - z, so z is its own conjugate.) We have seen that if we allow complex numbers as solutions, then every quadratic equation has a solution. More generally, it is true that every polynomial equation a n x n 1 a n21 x n21 1 ∙∙∙ 1 a 1 x 1 a 0 - 0 of degree at least one has a solution among the complex numbers. This fact is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and was proved by Gauss. Polar Form We know that any complex number z - a 1 bi can be considered as a point sa, bd and that any such point can be represented by polar coordinates sr, d with r > 0. In fact, a - r cos  b - r sin  as in Figure 4. Therefore we have z - a 1 bi - sr cos d 1 sr sin di Thus we can write any complex number z in the form z - r scos  1 i sin d where r - | z | - sa 2 1 b 2 and tan  - b a The angle  is called the argument of z and we write  - argszd. Note that argszd is not unique; any two arguments of z differ by an integer multiple of 2. EXAMPLE 4 Write the following numbers in polar form. (a) z - 1 1 i (b) w - s3 2 i SOLUTION (a) We have r - | z | - s1 2 1 1 2 - s2 and tan  - 1, so we can take  - y4. Therefore the polar form is z - s2 S cos  4 1 i sin  4 D (b) Here we have r - | w | - s3 1 1 - 2 and tan  - 21ys3 . Since w lies in the fourth quadrant, we take  - 2y6 and w - 2 F cos S 2  6 D 1 i sin S 2  6 DG The numbers z and w are shown in Figure 5. ■ Re Im 0 a+bi b ¨ r a a FIGURE 4 Re Im 0 oe„ 3-i 2 1+i oe„ 2 π 4 _ π 6 FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","APPENDIX H Complex Numbers A63 Complex Exponentials We also need to give a meaning to the expression e z when z - x 1 iy is a complex num- ber. The theory of infinite series as developed in Chapter 11 can be extended to the case where the terms are complex numbers.

","Cut here and keep for reference CHAPTER 8 CONCEPT CHECK ANSWERS The consumer surplus represents the amount of money saved by consumers in purchasing the commodity at price P [when they were willing to purchase it at price ps xd], corresponding to an amount demanded of X. consumer surplus 0 x p (X, P ) P X p=p(x) p=P 7. (a) What is the cardiac output of the heart? It is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit time, that is, the rate of low into the aorta. (b) Explain how the cardiac output can be measured by the dye dilution method. An amount A of dye is injected into part of the heart and its concentration cs t d leaving the heart is measured over a time interval [0, T ] until the dye has cleared. The cardiac output is given by Ayy T 0 c s t d dt. 8. What is a probability density function? What properties does such a function have? Given a random variable X, its probability density function f is a function such that y b a f s xd dx gives the probability that X lies between a and b. The function f has the properties that f s xd > 0 for all x, and y ` 2` f s xd dx - 1. 9. Suppose f s xd is the probability density function for the weight of a female college student, where x is measured in pounds. (a) What is the meaning of the integral y 130 0 f s xd dx? It represents the probability that a randomly chosen female college student weighs less than 130 pounds. (b) Write an expression for the mean of this density function.  - y ` 2` x f s xd dx - y ` 0 xf s xd dx [since f s xd - 0 for x , 0] (c) How can we ind the median of this density function? The median of f is the number m such that y ` m f s xd dx - 1 2 10. What is a normal distribution? What is the signiicance of the standard deviation? A normal distribution corresponds to a random variable X that has a probability density function with a bell-shaped graph and equation given by f s xd - 1  s2 e 2s x2d 2 ys2 2 d where  is the mean and the positive constant  is the stan- dard deviation.  measures how spread out the values of X are. 1. (a) How is the length of a curve deined? We can approximate a curve C by a polygon with vertices Pi along C. The length L of C is deined to be the limit of the lengths of these inscribed polygons: L - lim n l` o n i-1 | Pi21Pi | (b) Write an expression for the length of a smooth curve given by y - f s xd, a < x < b. L - y b a s1 1 f f 9 s xdg 2 dx (c) What if x is given as a function of y? If x - ts yd, c < y < d, then L - y d c s1 1 f t9 s ydg 2 dy. 2. (a) Write an expression for the surface area of the surface obtained by rotating the curve y - f s xd, a < x < b, about the x-axis. S - y b a 2 f s xd s1 1 f f 9 sxdg 2 dx (b) What if x is given as a function of y? If x - ts yd, c < y < d, then S - y d c 2 ys1 1 f t9s y dg 2 dy . (c) What if the curve is rotated about the y-axis? S - y b a 2x s1 1 f f 9 sxdg 2 dx or S - y d c 2ts yd s1 1 f t9s y dg 2 dy 3. Describe how we can ind the hydrostatic force against a vertical wall submersed in a luid. We divide the wall into horizontal strips of equal height Dx and approximate each by a rectangle with horizontal length f s x i d at depth x i. If  is the weight density of the luid, then the hydrostatic force is F - lim n l` o n i-1 x i f s x i d Dx - y b a x f s xd dx 4. (a) What is the physical signiicance of the center of mass of a thin plate? The center of mass is the point at which the plate balances horizontally. (b) If the plate lies between y - f s xd and y - 0, where a < x < b, write expressions for the coordinates of the center of mass. x - 1 A y b a xf s xd dx and y - 1 A y b a 1 2 f f s xdg 2 dx where A - y b a f s xd dx. 5. What does the Theorem of Pappus say? If a plane region 5 that lies entirely on one side of a line / in its plane is rotated about /, then the volume of the resulting solid is the product of the area of 5 and the distance traveled by the centroid of 5. 6. Given a demand function ps xd, explain what is meant by the consumer surplus when the amount of a commodity currently available is X and the current selling price is P . Illustrate with a sketch.

We then integrate both sides and solve for y. 7. (a) Write a differential equation that expresses the law of natural growth. What does it say in terms of relative growth rate? If Ps t d is the value of a quantity y at time t and if the rate of change of P with respect to t is proportional to its size Ps t d at any time, then dP dt - kP. In this case the relative growth rate, 1 P dP dt , is constant. (b) Under what circumstances is this an appropriate model for population growth? It is an appropriate model under ideal conditions: unlim- ited environment, adequate nutrition, absence of predators and disease. (c) What are the solutions of this equation? If Ps0d - P0 , the initial value, then the solutions are Ps t d - P0e kt . 8. (a) Write the logistic differential equation. The logistic differential equation is dP dt - kP S 1 2 P M D where M is the carrying capacity. (b) Under what circumstances is this an appropriate model for population growth? It is an appropriate model for population growth if the population grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population in the beginning, but eventually levels off and approaches its carrying capacity because of limited resources. 9. (a) Write Lotka-Volterra equations to model populations of food-ish s Fd and sharks s Sd. dF dt - kF 2 aFS and dS dt - 2rS 1 bFS (b) What do these equations say about each population in the absence of the other? In the absence of sharks, an ample food supply would support exponential growth of the ish population, that is, dFydt - kF, where k is a positive constant. In the absence of ish, we assume that the shark population would decline at a rate proportional to itself, that is dSydt - 2rS, where r is a positive constant. 1. (a) What is a differential equation? It is an equation that contains an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. (b) What is the order of a differential equation? It is the order of the highest derivative that occurs in the equation. (c) What is an initial condition? It is a condition of the form y s t 0d - y 0. 2. What can you say about the solutions of the equation y9 - x 2 1 y 2 just by looking at the differential equation? The equation tells us that the slope of a solution curve at any point s x, yd is x 2 1 y 2 . Note that x 2 1 y 2 is always positive except at the origin, where y9 - x 2 1 y 2 - 0. Thus there is a horizontal tangent at s0, 0d but nowhere else and the solution curves are increasing everywhere. 3. What is a direction ield for the differential equation y9 - Fs x, yd? A direction ield (or slope ield) for the differential equation y9 - Fs x, yd is a two-dimensional graph consisting of short line segments with slope Fs x, yd at point s x, yd. 4. Explain how Euler’s method works. Euler’s method says to start at the point given by the initial value and proceed in the direction indicated by the direction ield. Stop after a short time, look at the slope at the new loca- tion, and proceed in that direction. Keep stopping and chang- ing direction according to the direction ield until the approxi- mation is complete. 5. What is a separable differential equation? How do you solve it? It is a differential equation in which the expression for dy ydx can be factored as a function of x times a function of y, that is, dy ydx - ts xd f s yd. We can solve the equation by rewriting it as f1yf s ydg dy - ts xd dx, integrating both sides, and solving for y. 6. What is a irst-order linear differential equation? How do you solve it? A irst-order linear differential equation is a differential equa- tion that can be put in the form dy dx 1 Ps xd y - Qs xd where P and Q are continuous functions on a given interval. To solve such an equation, we multiply both sides by the integrating factor Is xd - e y Ps xd dx to put it in the form Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

A parametric curve is a set of points of the form s x, yd - s f s t d, ts t dd, where f and t are functions of a vari- able t, the parameter. (b) How do you sketch a parametric curve? Sketching a parametric curve, like sketching the graph of a function, is dificult to do in general. We can plot points on the curve by inding f std and tstd for various values of t, either by hand or with a calculator or computer. Sometimes, when f and t are given by formulas, we can eliminate t from the equations x - f std and y - tstd to get a Cartesian equation relating x and y. It may be easier to graph that equation than to work with the original formu- las for x and y in terms of t. 2. (a) How do you ind the slope of a tangent to a parametric curve?

How do you ind the cross product a 3 b of two vectors if you know their lengths and the angle between them? What if you know their components? If  is the angle between a and b (0 <  < ), then a 3 b is the vector with length | a 3 b | - | a || b | sin  and direction orthogonal to both a and b, as given by the right-hand rule.

The cross product can be used to create a vector orthogonal to two given vectors and it can be used to compute the area of a parallelogram determined by two vectors. Two nonzero vectors are parallel if and only if their cross product is 0. In addition, if a force acts on a rigid body, then the torque vector is the cross product of the position and force vectors. 1. What is the difference between a vector and a scalar? A scalar is a real number, whereas a vector is a quantity that has both a real-valued magnitude and a direction. 2. How do you add two vectors geometrically? How do you add them algebraically? To add two vectors geometrically, we can use either the Triangle Law or the Parallelogram Law: v u+v u v v+u u u v u+v Triangle Law Parallelogram Law Algebraically, we add the corresponding components of the vectors. 3. If a is a vector and c is a scalar, how is c a related to a geometrically? How do you ind c a algebraically? For c . 0, c a is a vector with the same direction as a and length c times the length of a. If c , 0, c a points in the direc- tion opposite to a and has length | c | times the length of a. Algebraically, to ind c a we multiply each component of a by c. 4. How do you ind the vector from one point to another?

The dot product can be used to ind the angle between two vectors. In particular, it can be used to determine whether two vectors are orthogonal. We can also use the dot product to ind the scalar projection of one vector onto another. Additionally, if a constant force moves an object, the work done is the dot product of the force and displacement vectors. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","CHAPTER 12 CONCEPT CHECK ANSWERS (continued) (c) How do you tell if two planes are parallel? Two planes are parallel if and only if their normal vectors are parallel. 16. (a) Describe a method for determining whether three points P, Q, and R lie on the same line. Determine the vectors PQ l - a and PR l - b. If there is a scalar t such that a - t b, then the vectors are parallel and the points must all lie on the same line. Alternatively, if PQ l 3 PR l - 0, then PQ l and PR l are parallel, so P, Q, and R are collinear. An algebraic method is to determine an equation of the line joining two of the points, and then check whether or not the third point satisies this equation. (b) Describe a method for determining whether four points P, Q, R, and S lie in the same plane. Find the vectors PQ l - a, PR l - b, PS l - c. Then a 3 b is normal to the plane formed by P, Q, and R, and so S lies on this plane if a 3 b and c are orthogonal, that is, if sa 3 bd  c - 0. Alternatively, we can check if the volume of the paral- lelepiped determined by a, b, and c is 0 (see Example 12.4.5). An algebraic method is to ind an equation of the plane determined by three of the points, and then check whether or not the fourth point satisies this equation. 17.

Two skew lines L1 and L2 can be viewed as lying on two parallel planes, each with normal vector n - v1 3 v2, where v1 and v2 are the direction vectors of L1 and L2. After choosing one point on L1 and determining the equa- tion of the plane containing L2, we can proceed as in part (b). (See Example 12.5.10.) 10. (a) How do you ind the area of the parallelogram deter- mined by a and b? The area of the parallelogram determined by a and b is the length of the cross product: | a 3 b | . (b) How do you ind the volume of the parallelepiped determined by a, b, and c? The volume of the parallelepiped determined by a, b, and c is the magnitude of their scalar triple product: | a  sb 3 cd | . 11. How do you ind a vector perpendicular to a plane? If an equation of the plane is known, it can be written in the form ax 1 by 1 cz 1 d - 0. A normal vector, which is perpendicular to the plane, is k a, b, c l (or any nonzero scalar multiple of k a, b, c l). If an equation is not known, we can use points on the plane to ind two nonparallel vectors that lie in the plane. The cross product of these vectors is a vector per- pendicular to the plane. 12. How do you ind the angle between two intersecting planes? The angle between two intersecting planes is deined as the acute angle  between their normal vectors. If n1 and n2 are the normal vectors, then cos  - n1  n2 | n1 || n2 | 13. Write a vector equation, parametric equations, and symmetric equations for a line. A vector equation for a line that is parallel to a vector v and that passes through a point with position vector r 0 is r - r0 1 t v. Parametric equations for a line through the point s x 0, y 0, z0d and parallel to the vector k a, b, c l are x - x 0 1 at y - y0 1 bt z - z0 1 ct while symmetric equations are x 2 x 0 a - y 2 y0 b - z 2 z0 c 14. Write a vector equation and a scalar equation for a plane. A vector equation of a plane that passes through a point with position vector r 0 and that has normal vector n (meaning n is orthogonal to the plane) is n  sr 2 r0 d - 0 or, equivalently, n  r - n  r0.

Two (nonzero) vectors are parallel if and only if one is a scalar multiple of the other. In addition, two nonzero vec- tors are parallel if and only if their cross product is 0.

Unit normal vector: Nstd - T9 std | T9 std | Binormal vector: Bstd - Tstd 3 Nstd (b) What is the normal plane of a curve at a point? What is the osculating plane? What is the osculating circle? The normal plane of a curve at a point P is the plane determined by the normal and binormal vectors N and B at P. The tangent vector T is orthogonal to the normal plane. The osculating plane at P is the plane determined by the vectors T and N. It is the plane that comes closest to con- taining the part of the curve near P. The osculating circle at P is the circle that lies in the osculating plane of C at P, has the same tangent as C at P, lies on the concave side of C (toward which N points), and has radius  - 1y (the reciprocal of the curvature). It is the circle that best describes how C behaves near P; it shares the same tangent, normal, and curvature at P . 1. What is a vector function? How do you ind its derivative and its integral? A vector function is a function whose domain is a set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors. To ind the derivative or integral, we can differentiate or integrate each component function of the vector function. 2. What is the connection between vector functions and space curves? A continuous vector function r deines a space curve that is traced out by the tip of the moving position vector rs t d. 3. How do you ind the tangent vector to a smooth curve at a point?

How do you interpret them as rates of change? If f sa, bd - c, then the point Psa, b, cd lies on the surface S given by z - f s x, yd. We can interpret fx sa, bd as the slope of the tangent line at P to the curve of intersection of the vertical plane y - b and S. In other words, if we restrict ourselves to the path along S through P that is par- allel to the x z-plane, then fx sa, bd is the slope at P looking in the positive x-direction. Similarly, fy sa, bd is the slope of the tangent line at P to the curve of intersection of the vertical plane x - a and S. If z - f s x, yd, then fx s x, yd can be interpreted as the rate of change of z with respect to x when y is ixed. Thus fx sa, bd is the rate of change of z (with respect to x) when y is ixed at b and x is allowed to vary from a. Similarly, fy sa, bd is the rate of change of z (with respect to y) when x is ixed at a and y is allowed to vary from b. (c) If f s x, yd is given by a formula, how do you calculate fx and fy ? To ind f x, regard y as a constant and differentiate f s x, yd with respect to x. To ind f y, regard x as a constant and differentiate f s x, yd with respect to y. 6. What does Clairaut’s Theorem say? If f is a function of two variables that is deined on a disk D containing the point sa, bd and the functions f xy and f yx are both continuous on D, then Clairaut’s Theorem states that fxy sa, bd - fyx sa, bd. 7. How do you ind a tangent plane to each of the following types of surfaces? (a) A graph of a function of two variables, z - f s x, yd If f has continuous partial derivatives, an equation of the tangent plane to the surface z - f s x, yd at the point s x 0, y 0, z0d is z 2 z 0 - f x s x 0, y 0ds x 2 x 0d 1 f y s x 0, y 0ds y 2 y 0d (b) A level surface of a function of three variables, Fs x, y, zd - k The tangent plane to the level surface Fs x, y, zd - k at Ps x 0, y 0, z 0d is the plane that passes through P and has normal vector =Fs x 0, y 0, z 0d: F x s x 0, y 0, z0ds x 2 x 0d 1 F y s x 0, y 0, z 0ds y 2 y 0d 1 F z s x 0, y 0, z 0ds z 2 z 0d - 0 1. (a) What is a function of two variables? A function f of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair s x, yd of real numbers in its domain a unique real number denoted by f s x, yd. (b) Describe three methods for visualizing a function of two variables. One way to visualize a function of two variables is by graphing it, resulting in the surface z - f s x, yd. Another method is a contour map, consisting of level curves f s x, yd - k (k a constant), which are horizontal traces of the graph of the function projected onto the xy-plane. Also, we can use an arrow diagram such as the one below. y x 0 z D f( a, b) f( x, y) ( x, y) ( a, b) 0 2. What is a function of three variables? How can you visualize such a function? A function f of three variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered triple s x, y, zd in its domain a unique real number f s x, y, zd. We can visualize a function of three variables by examining its level surfaces f s x, y, zd - k, where k is a constant. 3. What does lim s x, yd lsa, bd f s x, yd - L mean? How can you show that such a limit does not exist? lim s x, yd lsa, bd f s x, yd - L means that the values of f s x, yd approach the number L as the point s x, yd approaches the point sa, bd along any path that is within the domain of f . We can show that a limit at a point does not exist by inding two dif- ferent paths approaching the point along which f s x, yd has different limits. 4. (a) What does it mean to say that f is continuous at sa, bd? A function f of two variables is continuous at sa, bd if lim s x, yd lsa, bd f s x, yd - f sa, bd (b) If f is continuous on R 2 , what can you say about its graph?

(a) Write an expression as a limit for the directional deriva- tive of f at s x 0, y0 d in the direction of a unit vector u - k a, b l. How do you interpret it as a rate? How do you interpret it geometrically? The directional derivative of f at s x 0, y0 d in the direction of u is Du f s x 0, y0 d - lim h l0 f s x 0 1 ha, y0 1 hbd 2 f s x 0, y0 d h if this limit exists. We can interpret it as the rate of change of f (with respect to distance) at s x 0, y0 d in the direction of u. Geometrically, if P is the point s x0, y0, f s x0, y0dd on the graph of f and C is the curve of intersection of the graph of f with the vertical plane that passes through P in the direction of u, then Du f s x 0, y0 d is the slope of the tangent line to C at P.

(a) What does it mean to say that f is differentiable at sa, bd? If z - f s x, yd, then f is differentiable at sa, bd if Dz can be expressed in the form Dz - f x sa, bd Dx 1 f y sa, bd Dy 1«1 Dx 1«2 Dy where «1 and «2 l 0 as sDx, Dyd l s0, 0d.

(b) How do you usually verify that f is differentiable? If the partial derivatives f x and f y exist near sa, bd and are continuous at sa, bd, then f is differentiable at sa, bd. 10. If z - f s x, yd, what are the differentials dx, dy, and dz? The differentials dx and dy are independent variables that can be given any values.

What is a bounded set? A closed set in R 2 is one that contains all its boundary points. If one or more points on the boundary curve are omitted, the set is not closed. A bounded set is one that is contained within some disk. In other words, it is inite in extent. (b) State the Extreme Value Theorem for functions of two variables. If f is continuous on a closed, bounded set D in R 2 , then f attains an absolute maximum value f s x 1, y1d and an absolute minimum value f s x 2, y2d at some points s x 1, y1d and s x 2, y2d in D. (c) How do you ind the values that the Extreme Value Theorem guarantees? ■ Find the values of f at the critical points of f in D. ■ Find the extreme values of f on the boundary of D. ■ The largest of the values from the above steps is the absolute maximum value; the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value. 19. Explain how the method of Lagrange multipliers works in inding the extreme values of f s x, y, zd subject to the con- straint ts x, y, zd - k. What if there is a second constraint hs x, y, zd - c? To ind the maximum and minimum values of f s x, y, zd subject to the constraint t s x, y, zd - k [assuming that these extreme values exist and =t ± 0 on the surface t s x, y, zd - k], we irst ind all values of x, y, z, and  where = f s x, y, zd -  =t s x, y, zd and t s x, y, zd - k. (Thus we are inding the points from the constraint where the gradient vec- tors =f and =t are parallel.) Evaluate f at all the resulting points s x, y, zd; the largest of these values is the maximum value of f , and the smallest is the minimum value of f . If there is a second constraint hs x, y, zd - c, then we ind all values of x, y, z, , and  such that = f s x, y, zd -  =ts x, y, zd 1  =hs x, y, zd Again we ind the extreme values of f by evaluating f at the resulting points s x, y, zd. (c) Explain the geometric signiicance of the gradient. The gradient vector of f gives the direction of maximum rate of increase of f . On the graph of z - f s x, yd, =f points in the direction of steepest ascent. Also, the gradi- ent vector is perpendicular to the level curves or level surfaces of a function. 15. What do the following statements mean? (a) f has a local maximum at sa, bd. f has a local maximum at sa, bd if f s x, yd < f sa, bd when s x, yd is near sa, bd.

(d) f has an absolute minimum at sa, bd. f has an absolute minimum at sa, bd if f s x, yd > f sa, bd for all points s x, yd in the domain of f . (e) f has a saddle point at sa, bd. f has a saddle point at sa, bd if f sa, bd is a local maximum in one direction but a local minimum in another. 16. (a) If f has a local maximum at sa, bd, what can you say about its partial derivatives at sa, bd? If f has a local maximum at sa, bd and the irst-order partial derivatives of f exist there, then fx sa, bd - 0 and fy sa, bd - 0. (b) What is a critical point of f ? A critical point of f is a point sa, bd such that fx sa, bd - 0 and fy sa, bd - 0 or one of these partial derivatives does not exist. 17. State the Second Derivatives Test. Suppose the second partial derivatives of f are continuous on a disk with center sa, bd, and suppose that fx sa, bd - 0 and fy sa, bd - 0 [that is, sa, bd is a critical point of f ]. Let D - Dsa, bd - fxx sa, bd fyy sa, bd 2 f fxy sa, bdg 2 ■ If D . 0 and fxx sa, bd . 0, then f sa, bd is a local minimum. ■ If D . 0 and fxx sa, bd , 0, then f sa, bd is a local maximum. ■ If D , 0, then f sa, bd is not a local maximum or minimum.

Also, sometimes the integrand is easier to integrate using cylindrical or spherical coordinates. 10.

At a point in the luid, the vector curl F aligns with the axis about which the luid tends to rotate, and its length measures the speed of rotation; div F at a point measures the tendency of the luid to low away (diverge) from that point. 10. If F - P i 1 Q j, how do you determine whether F is conser- vative? What if F is a vector ield on R 3 ? If P and Q have continuous irst-order derivatives and -P -y - -Q -x , then F is conservative.
