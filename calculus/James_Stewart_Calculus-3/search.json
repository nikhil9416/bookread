","791 Each of these gears has the shape of a hyperboloid, a type of surface we will study in Section 12.6. The shape allows the gears to transmit motion between skew (neither parallel nor intersecting) axes. IN THIS CHAPTER WE INTRODUCE vectors and coordinate systems for three-dimensional space. This will be the setting for our study of the calculus of functions of two variables in Chapter 14 because the graph of such a function is a surface in space. In this chapter we will see that vectors provide particularly simple descriptions of lines and planes in space. 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","792 CHAPTER 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space 3D Space To locate a point in a plane, we need two numbers. We know that any point in the plane can be represented as an ordered pair sa, bd of real numbers, where a is the x-coordinate and b is the y-coordinate. For this reason, a plane is called two-dimensional. To locate a point in space, three numbers are required. We represent any point in space by an ordered triple sa, b, cd of real numbers. In order to represent points in space, we irst choose a ixed point O (the origin) and three directed lines through O that are perpendicular to each other, called the coordinate axes and labeled the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. Usually we think of the x- and y-axes as being horizontal and the z-axis as being vertical, and we draw the orientation of the axes as in Figure 1. The direction of the z-axis is determined by the right-hand rule as illus- trated in Figure 2: If you curl the ingers of your right hand around the z-axis in the direc- tion of a 90° counterclockwise rotation from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis, then your thumb points in the positive direction of the z-axis. The three coordinate axes determine the three coordinate planes illustrated in Fig- ure 3(a). The xy-plane is the plane that contains the x- and y-axes; the yz-plane contains the y- and z-axes; the xz-plane contains the x- and z-axes. These three coordinate planes divide space into eight parts, called octants. The irst octant, in the foreground, is deter- mined by the positive axes. (a) Coordinate planes y z x O yz-plane xy-plane xz-plane (b) z O right wall left wall y x floor Because many people have some dificulty visualizing diagrams of three-dimensional igures, you may ind it helpful to do the following [see Figure 3(b)]. Look at any bottom corner of a room and call the corner the origin. The wall on your left is in the xz-plane, the wall on your right is in the yz-plane, and the loor is in the xy-plane. The x-axis runs along the intersection of the loor and the left wall. The y-axis runs along the intersection of the loor and the right wall. The z-axis runs up from the loor toward the ceiling along the intersection of the two walls. You are situated in the irst octant, and you can now imagine seven other rooms situated in the other seven octants (three on the same loor and four on the loor below), all connected by the common corner point O. Now if P is any point in space, let a be the (directed) distance from the y z-plane to P , let b be the distance from the xz-plane to P , and let c be the distance from the xy-plane to P. We represent the point P by the ordered triple sa, b, cd of real numbers and we call a, b, and c the coordinates of P; a is the x-coordinate, b is the y-coordinate, and c is the z-coordinate. Thus, to locate the point sa, b, cd, we can start at the origin O and move a units along the x-axis, then b units parallel to the y-axis, and then c units parallel to the z-axis as in Figure 4.

","SECTION 12.1 Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems 793 The point Psa, b, cd determines a rectangular box as in Figure 5. If we drop a perpen- dicular from P to the xy-plane, we get a point Q with coordinates sa, b, 0d called the pro- jection of P onto the xy-plane. Similarly, Rs0, b, cd and Ssa, 0, cd are the projections of P onto the y z-plane and xz-plane, respectively. As numerical illustrations, the points s24, 3, 25d and s3, 22, 26d are plotted in Fig- ure 6.

We have given a one-to-one correspon- dence between points P in space and ordered triples sa, b, cd in R 3 . It is called a three- dimensional rectangular coordinate system. Notice that, in terms of coordinates, the irst octant can be described as the set of points whose coordinates are all positive. Surfaces In two-dimensional analytic geometry, the graph of an equation involving x and y is a curve in R 2 . In three-dimensional analytic geometry, an equation in x, y, and z represents a surface in R 3 . EXAMPLE 1 What surfaces in R 3 are represented by the following equations? (a) z - 3 (b) y - 5 SOLUTION (a) The equation z - 3 represents the set hs x, y, zd | z - 3j, which is the set of all points in R 3 whose z-coordinate is 3 (x and y can each be any value). This is the horizontal plane that is parallel to the xy-plane and three units above it as in Figure 7(a).

","794 CHAPTER 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space NOTE When an equation is given, we must understand from the context whether it rep- resents a curve in R 2 or a surface in R 3 . In Example 1, y - 5 represents a plane in R 3 , but of course y - 5 can also represent a line in R 2 if we are dealing with two-dimensional analytic geometry. See Figure 7(b) and (c). In general, if k is a constant, then x - k represents a plane parallel to the yz-plane, y - k is a plane parallel to the xz-plane, and z - k is a plane parallel to the xy-plane. In Figure 5, the faces of the rectangular box are formed by the three coordinate planes x - 0 (the yz-plane), y - 0 (the xz-plane), and z - 0 (the xy-plane), and the planes x - a, y - b, and z - c. EXAMPLE 2 (a) Which points s x, y, zd satisfy the equations x 2 1 y 2 - 1 and z - 3 (b) What does the equation x 2 1 y 2 - 1 represent as a surface in R 3 ? SOLUTION (a) Because z - 3, the points lie in the horizontal plane z - 3 from Example 1(a). Because x 2 1 y 2 - 1, the points lie on the circle with radius 1 and center on the z-axis. See Figure 8. (b) Given that x 2 1 y 2 - 1, with no restrictions on z, we see that the point s x, y, zd could lie on a circle in any horizontal plane z - k. So the surface x 2 1 y 2 - 1 in R 3 consists of all possible horizontal circles x 2 1 y 2 - 1, z - k, and is therefore the circu- lar cylinder with radius 1 whose axis is the z-axis. See Figure 9. 0 3 z x y 0 z x y FIGURE 8 The circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1, z - 3 FIGURE 9 The cylinder x 2 1 y 2 - 1 ■ EXAMPLE 3 Describe and sketch the surface in R 3 represented by the equation y - x. SOLUTION The equation represents the set of all points in R 3 whose x- and y-coordi- nates are equal, that is, hs x, x, zd | x [ R, z [ Rj. This is a vertical plane that intersects the xy-plane in the line y - x, z - 0. The portion of this plane that lies in the irst octant is sketched in Figure 10. ■ Distance and Spheres The familiar formula for the distance between two points in a plane is easily extended to the following three-dimensional formula. 0 y z x FIGURE 10 The plane y - x Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 12.1 Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems 795 Distance Formula in Three Dimensions The distance | P 1 P 2 | between the points P 1 s x 1 , y 1 , z 1 d and P 2 s x 2 , y 2 , z 2 d is | P 1 P 2 | - ss x 2 2 x 1 d 2 1 s y 2 2 y 1 d 2 1 sz 2 2 z 1 d 2 To see why this formula is true, we construct a rectangular box as in Figure 11, where P 1 and P 2 are opposite vertices and the faces of the box are parallel to the coordinate planes. If As x 2 , y 1 , z 1 d and Bs x 2 , y 2 , z 1 d are the vertices of the box indicated in the igure, then | P 1 A | - | x 2 2 x 1 | | AB | - | y 2 2 y 1 | | BP 2 | - | z 2 2 z 1 | Because triangles P 1 BP 2 and P 1 AB are both right-angled, two applications of the Pythago- rean Theorem give | P 1 P 2 | 2 - | P 1 B | 2 1 | BP 2 | 2 and | P 1 B | 2 - | P 1 A | 2 1 | AB | 2 Combining these equations, we get | P 1 P 2 | 2 - | P 1 A | 2 1 | AB | 2 1 | BP 2 | 2 - | x 2 2 x 1 | 2 1 | y 2 2 y 1 | 2 1 | z 2 2 z 1 | 2 - s x 2 2 x 1 d 2 1 s y 2 2 y 1 d 2 1 sz 2 2 z 1 d 2 Therefore | P 1 P 2 | - ss x 2 2 x 1 d 2 1 s y 2 2 y 1 d 2 1 sz 2 2 z 1 d 2 EXAMPLE 4 The distance from the point Ps2, 21, 7d to the point Qs1, 23, 5d is | PQ | - ss1 2 2d 2 1 s23 1 1d 2 1 s5 2 7d 2 - s1 1 4 1 4 - 3 ■ EXAMPLE 5 Find an equation of a sphere with radius r and center Csh, k, l d. SOLUTION By deinition, a sphere is the set of all points Ps x, y, zd whose distance from C is r. (See Figure 12.) Thus P is on the sphere if and only if | PC | - r. Squaring both sides, we have | PC | 2 - r 2 or s x 2 hd 2 1 s y 2 kd 2 1 sz 2 l d 2 - r 2 ■ The result of Example 5 is worth remembering.

But we are also given that z < 0, so the points lie on or below the xy-plane. Thus the given inequalities represent the region that lies between (or on) the spheres x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 - 1 and x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 - 4 and beneath (or on) the xy-plane.

","798 CHAPTER 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space The term vector is used by scientists to indicate a quantity (such as displacement or velocity or force) that has both magnitude and direction. A vector is often represented by an arrow or a directed line segment. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector and the arrow points in the direction of the vector. We denote a vector by print- ing a letter in boldface svd or by putting an arrow above the letter s v l d. For instance, suppose a particle moves along a line segment from point A to point B. The corresponding displacement vector v, shown in Figure 1, has initial point A (the tail) and terminal point B (the tip) and we indicate this by writing v - AB l . Notice that the vector u - CD l has the same length and the same direction as v even though it is in a different position. We say that u and v are equivalent (or equal) and we write u - v. The zero vector, denoted by 0, has length 0. It is the only vector with no speciic direction. Combining Vectors Suppose a particle moves from A to B, so its displacement vector is AB l . Then the particle changes direction and moves from B to C, with displacement vector BC l as in Figure 2. The combined effect of these displacements is that the particle has moved from A to C. The resulting displacement vector AC l is called the sum of AB l and BC l and we write AC l - AB l 1 BC l In general, if we start with vectors u and v, we irst move v so that its tail coincides with the tip of u and deine the sum of u and v as follows. Deinition of Vector Addition If u and v are vectors positioned so the initial point of v is at the terminal point of u, then the sum u 1 v is the vector from the initial point of u to the terminal point of v. The deinition of vector addition is illustrated in Figure 3. You can see why this dei- nition is sometimes called the Triangle Law. v u+v u FIGURE 3 The Triangle Law v v+u u u v u+v FIGURE 4 The Parallelogram Law In Figure 4 we start with the same vectors u and v as in Figure 3 and draw another copy of v with the same initial point as u. Completing the parallelogram, we see that u 1 v - v 1 u. This also gives another way to construct the sum: if we place u and v so they start at the same point, then u 1 v lies along the diagonal of the parallelogram with u and v as sides. (This is called the Parallelogram Law.) EXAMPLE 1 Draw the sum of the vectors a and b shown in Figure 5. SOLUTION First we move b and place its tail at the tip of a, being careful to draw a copy of b that has the same length and direction. Then we draw the vector a 1 b [see A B v C D u FIGURE 1 Equivalent vectors C B A FIGURE 2 a b FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Alternatively, we could place b so it starts where a starts and construct a 1 b by the Parallelogram Law as in Figure 6(b). a b a+b (a) a a+b b (b) ■ It is possible to multiply a vector by a real number c. (In this context we call the real num- ber c a scalar to distinguish it from a vector.) For instance, we want 2v to be the same vector as v 1 v, which has the same direction as v but is twice as long. In general, we mul- tiply a vector by a scalar as follows. Deinition of Scalar Multiplication If c is a scalar and v is a vector, then the scalar multiple cv is the vector whose length is | c | times the length of v and whose direction is the same as v if c . 0 and is opposite to v if c , 0. If c - 0 or v - 0, then cv - 0. This deinition is illustrated in Figure 7. We see that real numbers work like scaling fac- tors here; that’s why we call them scalars. Notice that two nonzero vectors are parallel if they are scalar multiples of one another. In particular, the vector 2v - s21dv has the same length as v but points in the opposite direction. We call it the negative of v. _1.5v v 2v _v v 1 2 By the difference u 2 v of two vectors we mean u 2 v - u 1 s2vd So we can construct u 2 v by irst drawing the negative of v, 2v, and then adding it to u by the Parallelogram Law as in Figure 8(a). Alternatively, since v 1 su 2 vd - u, the vector u 2 v, when added to v, gives u. So we could construct u 2 v as in Figure 8(b) by means of the Triangle Law. Notice that if u and v both start from the same initial point, then u 2 v connects the tip of v to the tip of u.

","800 CHAPTER 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space EXAMPLE 2 If a and b are the vectors shown in Figure 9, draw a 2 2b. SOLUTION We irst draw the vector 22b pointing in the direction opposite to b and twice as long. We place it with its tail at the tip of a and then use the Triangle Law to draw a 1 s22bd as in Figure 10. ■ Components For some purposes it’s best to introduce a coordinate system and treat vectors algebra- ically. If we place the initial point of a vector a at the origin of a rectangular coordinate system, then the terminal point of a has coordinates of the form sa 1 , a 2 d or sa 1 , a 2 , a 3 d, depending on whether our coordinate system is two- or three-dimensional (see Figure 11). These coordinates are called the components of a and we write a - k a 1 , a 2 l or a - ka 1 , a 2 , a 3 l We use the notation ka 1 , a 2 l for the ordered pair that refers to a vector so as not to confuse it with the ordered pair sa 1 , a 2 d that refers to a point in the plane. a=ka¡, a™l a=ka¡, a™, a£l (a¡, a™) O y x a z x y a O (a¡, a™, a£) For instance, the vectors shown in Figure 12 are all equivalent to the vector OP l - k3, 2l whose terminal point is Ps3, 2d. What they have in common is that the terminal point is reached from the initial point by a displacement of three units to the right and two upward. We can think of all these geometric vectors as representations of the algebraic vector a - k 3, 2 l. The particular representation OP l from the origin to the point Ps3, 2d is called the position vector of the point P. In three dimensions, the vector a - OP l - ka 1 , a 2 , a 3 l is the position vector of the point Psa 1 , a 2 , a 3 d. (See Figure 13.) Let’s consider any other representation AB l of a, where the initial point is As x 1 , y 1 , z 1 d and the terminal point is Bs x 2 , y 2 , z 2 d. Then we must have x 1 1 a 1 - x 2 , y 1 1 a 2 - y 2 , and z 1 1 a 3 - z 2 and so a 1 - x 2 2 x 1 , a 2 - y 2 2 y 1 , and a 3 - z 2 2 z 1 . Thus we have the following result. 1 Given the points As x 1 , y 1 , z 1 d and Bs x 2 , y 2 , z 2 d, the vector a with represen- tation AB l is a - k x 2 2 x 1 , y 2 2 y 1 , z 2 2 z 1 l EXAMPLE 3 Find the vector represented by the directed line segment with initial point As2, 23, 4) and terminal point Bs22, 1, 1d.

","SECTION 12.2 Vectors 801 The magnitude or length of the vector v is the length of any of its representations and is denoted by the symbol | v | or i v i. By using the distance formula to compute the length of a segment OP, we obtain the following formulas. The length of the two-dimensional vector a - k a 1 , a 2 l is | a | - sa 2 1 1 a 2 2 The length of the three-dimensional vector a - ka 1 , a 2 , a 3 l is | a | - sa 2 1 1 a 2 2 1 a 2 3 0 y x b¡ a¡ b¡ b™ b a+b a (a¡+b¡, a™+b™) a™ a™ FIGURE 14 How do we add vectors algebraically?

In other words, to add algebraic vectors we add corresponding components. Similarly, to subtract vectors we subtract corresponding components. From the similar triangles in Figure 15 we see that the components of c a are ca 1 and ca 2 . So to multiply a vector by a scalar we multiply each component by that scalar.

","802 CHAPTER 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space We denote by V 2 the set of all two-dimensional vectors and by V 3 the set of all three- dimensional vectors. More generally, we will later need to consider the set V n of all n-dimensional vectors. An n-dimensional vector is an ordered n-tuple: a - k a 1 , a 2 ,..., a n l where a 1 , a 2 ,..., a n are real numbers that are called the components of a. Addition and scalar multiplication are deined in terms of components just as for the cases n - 2 and n - 3. Properties of Vectors If a, b, and c are vectors in V n and c and d are scalars, then 1. a 1 b - b 1 a 2. a 1 sb 1 cd - sa 1 bd 1 c 3. a 1 0 - a 4. a 1 s2ad - 0 5. c sa 1 bd - c a 1 c b 6. sc 1 d d a - c a 1 da 7. scd d a - csdad 8. 1a - a These eight properties of vectors can be readily veriied either geometrically or alge- braically. For instance, Property 1 can be seen from Figure 4 (it’s equivalent to the Paral- lelogram Law) or as follows for the case n - 2: a 1 b - k a 1 , a 2 l 1 k b 1 , b 2 l - k a 1 1 b 1 , a 2 1 b 2 l - k b 1 1 a 1 , b 2 1 a 2 l - k b 1 , b 2 l 1 k a 1 , a 2 l - b 1 a We can see why Property 2 (the associative law) is true by looking at Figure 16 and applying the Triangle Law several times: the vector PQ l is obtained either by irst con- structing a 1 b and then adding c or by adding a to the vector b 1 c. Three vectors in V 3 play a special role. Let i - k 1, 0, 0 l j - k 0, 1, 0 l k - k 0, 0, 1l These vectors i, j, and k are called the standard basis vectors. They have length 1 and point in the directions of the positive x-, y-, and z-axes. Similarly, in two dimensions we deine i - k 1, 0l and j - k 0, 1l. (See Figure 17.) (a) 0 y x j (1, 0) i (0, 1) (b) z x y j i k Vectors in n dimensions are used to list various quantities in an organized way. For instance, the components of a six- dimensional vector p - k p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , p5 , p6 l might represent the prices of six dif- ferent ingredients required to make a particular product. Four-dimensional vectors k x, y, z, t l are used in relativity theory, where the first three compo- nents specify a position in space and the fourth represents time. b c a (a+b)+c P Q =a+(b+c) a+b b+c FIGURE 16 FIGURE 17 Standard basis vectors in V2 and V3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 12.2 Vectors 803 If a - k a 1 , a 2 , a 3 l, then we can write a - k a 1 , a 2 , a 3 l - k a 1 , 0, 0 l 1 k 0, a 2 , 0 l 1 k 0, 0, a 3 l - a 1 k 1, 0, 0 l 1 a 2 k 0, 1, 0 l 1 a 3 k 0, 0, 1 l 2 a - a 1 i 1 a 2 j 1 a 3 k Thus any vector in V 3 can be expressed in terms of i, j, and k. For instance, k 1, 22, 6 l - i 2 2 j 1 6 k Similarly, in two dimensions, we can write 3 a - k a 1 , a 2 l - a 1 i 1 a 2 j See Figure 18 for the geometric interpretation of Equations 3 and 2 and compare with Figure 17. EXAMPLE 5 If a - i 1 2 j 2 3 k and b - 4 i 1 7 k, express the vector 2a 1 3b in terms of i, j, and k. SOLUTION Using Properties 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 of vectors, we have 2a 1 3b - 2si 1 2 j 2 3 kd 1 3s4 i 1 7 kd - 2 i 1 4 j 2 6 k 1 12 i 1 21 k - 14 i 1 4 j 1 15 k ■ A unit vector is a vector whose length is 1. For instance, i, j, and k are all unit vec- tors. In general, if a ± 0, then the unit vector that has the same direction as a is 4 u - 1 | a | a - a | a | In order to verify this, we let c - 1 y | a | . Then u - c a and c is a positive scalar, so u has the same direction as a. Also | u | - | c a | - | c || a | - 1 | a | | a | - 1 EXAMPLE 6 Find the unit vector in the direction of the vector 2 i 2 j 2 2 k. SOLUTION The given vector has length | 2 i 2 j 2 2 k | - s2 2 1 s21d 2 1 s22d 2 - s9 - 3 so, by Equation 4, the unit vector with the same direction is 1 3 s2 i 2 j 2 2 kd - 2 3 i 2 1 3 j 2 2 3 k ■ Applications Vectors are useful in many aspects of physics and engineering. In Chapter 13 we will see how they describe the velocity and acceleration of objects moving in space. Here we look at forces. A force is represented by a vector because it has both a magnitude (measured in pounds or newtons) and a direction. If several forces are acting on an object, the resul- tant force experienced by the object is the vector sum of these forces. Gibbs Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839–1903), a professor of mathematical physics at Yale College, published the irst book on vectors, Vector Analysis, in 1881. More complicated objects, called quaternions, had earlier been invented by Hamilton as mathemati- cal tools for describing space, but they weren’t easy for scientists to use. Quaternions have a scalar part and a vector part. Gibb’s idea was to use the vector part separately. Maxwell and Heaviside had similar ideas, but Gibb’s approach has proved to be the most convenient way to study space.

","SECTION 12.3 The Dot Product 807 So far we have added two vectors and multiplied a vector by a scalar. The question arises: is it possible to multiply two vectors so that their product is a useful quantity? One such product is the dot product, whose deinition follows. Another is the cross product, which is discussed in the next section. 1 Deinition If a - k a 1 , a 2 , a 3 l and b - k b 1 , b 2 , b 3 l, then the dot product of a and b is the number a ? b given by a ? b - a 1 b 1 1 a 2 b 2 1 a 3 b 3 Thus, to ind the dot product of a and b, we multiply corresponding components and add. The result is not a vector. It is a real number, that is, a scalar. For this reason, the dot product is sometimes called the scalar product (or inner product). Although Deini- tion 1 is given for three-dimensional vectors, the dot product of two-dimensional vectors is defined in a similar fashion: k a 1 , a 2 l ? k b 1 , b 2 l - a 1 b 1 1 a 2 b 2 EXAMPLE 1 k2, 4l ? k3, 21l - 2s3d 1 4s21d - 2 k21, 7, 4l ? k 6, 2, 2 1 2 l - s21ds6d 1 7s2d 1 4(2 1 2 ) - 6 si 1 2 j 2 3 kd ? s2 j 2 kd - 1s0d 1 2s2d 1 s23ds21d - 7 ■ The dot product obeys many of the laws that hold for ordinary products of real num- bers.

In other words,  is the angle between the line segments OA l and OB l in Figure 1. Note that if a and b are parallel vectors, then  - 0 or  - . The formula in the following theorem is used by physicists as the deinition of the dot product. 3 Theorem If  is the angle between the vectors a and b, then a ? b - | a || b | cos  PROOF If we apply the Law of Cosines to triangle OAB in Figure 1, we get 4 | AB | 2 - | OA | 2 1 | OB | 2 2 2 | OA || OB | cos  (Observe that the Law of Cosines still applies in the limiting cases when  - 0 or , or a - 0 or b - 0.)

We can think of a ? b as mea- suring the extent to which a and b point in the same direction. The dot product a ? b is positive if a and b point in the same general direction, 0 if they are perpendicular, and negative if they point in generally opposite directions (see Figure 2). In the extreme case where a and b point in exactly the same direction, we have  - 0, so cos  - 1 and a ? b - | a || b | If a and b point in exactly opposite directions, then we have  -  and so cos  - 21 and a ? b - 2 | a || b | . Direction Angles and Direction Cosines The direction angles of a nonzero vector a are the angles , , and  (in the interval f0, gd that a makes with the positive x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. (See Figure 3.) The cosines of these direction angles, cos , cos , and cos , are called the direction cosines of the vector a. Using Corollary 6 with b replaced by i, we obtain 8 cos  - a ? i | a || i | - a 1 | a | (This can also be seen directly from Figure 3.) Similarly, we also have 9 cos  - a 2 | a | cos  - a 3 | a | By squaring the expressions in Equations 8 and 9 and adding, we see that 10 cos 2  1 cos 2  1 cos 2  - 1 We can also use Equations 8 and 9 to write a - k a 1 , a 2 , a 3 l - k | a | cos , | a | cos , | a | cos  l - | a | kcos , cos , cos l Therefore 11 1 | a | a - k cos , cos , cos  l which says that the direction cosines of a are the components of the unit vector in the direction of a.

","SECTION 12.3 The Dot Product 811 Projections Figure 4 shows representations PQ l and PR l of two vectors a and b with the same initial point P. If S is the foot of the perpendicular from R to the line containing PQ l , then the vector with representation PS l is called the vector projection of b onto a and is denoted by proj a b. (You can think of it as a shadow of b). The scalar projection of b onto a (also called the component of b along a) is deined to be the signed magnitude of the vector projection, which is the number | b | cos , where  is the angle between a and b. (See Figure 5.) This is denoted by comp a b. Observe that it is negative if y2 ,  < . The equation a ? b - | a || b | cos  - | a | ( | b | cos ) shows that the dot product of a and b can be interpreted as the length of a times the sca- lar projection of b onto a. Since | b | cos  - a ? b | a | - a | a | ? b the component of b along a can be computed by taking the dot product of b with the unit vector in the direction of a. We summarize these ideas as follows. Scalar projection of b onto a: comp a b - a ? b | a | Vector projection of b onto a: proj a b - S a ? b | a | D a | a | - a ? b | a | 2 a Notice that the vector projection is the scalar projection times the unit vector in the direc- tion of a.

In Section 6.4 we deined the work done by a constant force F in moving an object through a distance d as W - Fd, but this applies only when the force is directed along the line of motion of the object. Suppose, however, that the constant force is a vector F - PR l pointing in some other direction, as in Figure 6. If the force moves the object from P to Q, then the dis- placement vector is D - PQ l . The work done by this force is deined to be the product of the component of the force along D and the distance moved: W - s | F | cos  d | D | TEC Visual 12.3B shows how Fig- ure 4 changes when we vary a and b.

","SECTION 12.4 The Cross Product 815 4 Deinition If a - k a 1 , a 2 , a 3 l and b - k b 1 , b 2 , b 3 l, then the cross product of a and b is the vector a 3 b - k a 2 b 3 2 a 3 b 2 , a 3 b 1 2 a 1 b 3 , a 1 b 2 2 a 2 b 1 l Hamilton The cross product was invented by the Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865), who had created a precursor of vectors, called quaternions. When he was ive years old Hamilton could read Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. At age eight he added French and Italian and when ten he could read Arabic and Sanskrit. At the age of 21, while still an under- graduate at Trinity College in Dublin, Hamilton was appointed Professor of Astronomy at the university and Royal Astronomer of Ireland! Notice that the cross product a 3 b of two vectors a and b, unlike the dot product, is a vector. For this reason it is also called the vector product. Note that a 3 b is deined only when a and b are three-dimensional vectors. In order to make Deinition 4 easier to remember, we use the notation of determinants. A determinant of order 2 is deined by Z a c b d Z - ad 2 bc (Multiply across the diagonals and subtract.) For example, Z 2 26 1 4 Z - 2s4d 2 1s26d - 14 A determinant of order 3 can be deined in terms of second-order determinants as follows: 5 Z a 1 b 1 c 1 a 2 b 2 c 2 a 3 b 3 c 3 Z - a 1 Z b 2 c 2 b 3 c 3 Z 2 a 2 Z b 1 c 1 b 3 c 3 Z 1 a 3 Z b 1 c 1 b 2 c 2 Z Observe that each term on the right side of Equation 5 involves a number a i in the irst row of the determinant, and a i is multiplied by the second-order determinant obtained from the left side by deleting the row and column in which a i appears. Notice also the minus sign in the second term. For example, Z 1 3 25 2 0 4 21 1 2 Z - 1 Z 0 4 1 2 Z 2 2 Z 3 25 1 2 Z 1 s21d Z 3 25 0 4 Z - 1s0 2 4d 2 2s6 1 5d 1 s21ds12 2 0d - 238 If we now rewrite Deinition 4 using second-order determinants and the standard basis vectors i, j, and k, we see that the cross product of the vectors a - a 1 i 1 a 2 j 1 a 3 k and b - b 1 i 1 b 2 j 1 b 3 k is 6 a 3 b - Z a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 Z i 2 Z a 1 b 1 a 3 b 3 Z j 1 Z a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 Z k In view of the similarity between Equations 5 and 6, we often write 7 a 3 b - Z i a 1 b 1 j a 2 b 2 k a 3 b 3 Z Although the irst row of the symbolic determinant in Equation 7 consists of vectors, if we expand it as if it were an ordinary determinant using the rule in Equation 5, we obtain Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This is one of the most important properties of a cross product, so let’s emphasize and verify it in the following theorem and give a formal proof. 8 Theorem The vector a 3 b is orthogonal to both a and b. PROOF In order to show that a 3 b is orthogonal to a, we compute their dot product as follows: sa 3 bd ? a - Z a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 Z a 1 2 Z a 1 b 1 a 3 b 3 Z a 2 1 Z a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 Z a 3 - a 1 sa 2 b 3 2 a 3 b 2 d 2 a 2 sa 1 b 3 2 a 3 b 1 d 1 a 3 sa 1 b 2 2 a 2 b 1 d - a 1 a 2 b 3 2 a 1 b 2 a 3 2 a 1 a 2 b 3 1 b 1 a 2 a 3 1 a 1 b 2 a 3 2 b 1 a 2 a 3 - 0 A similar computation shows that sa 3 bd ? b - 0. Therefore a 3 b is orthogonal to both a and b. ■ If a and b are represented by directed line segments with the same initial point (as in Figure 1), then Theorem 8 says that the cross product a 3 b points in a direction perpendicular to the plane through a and b. It turns out that the direction of a 3 b is given by the right-hand rule: if the ingers of your right hand curl in the direction of a b axb n ¨ FIGURE 1 The right-hand rule gives the direction of a 3 b.

","SECTION 12.4 The Cross Product 819 So the associative law for multiplication does not usually hold; that is, in general, sa 3 bd 3 c ± a 3 sb 3 cd However, some of the usual laws of algebra do hold for cross products.

(See Figure 3.) The area of the base parallelogram is A - | b 3 c | . If  is the angle between a and b 3 c, then the height h of the parallelepiped is h - | a || cos  | .

SOLUTION We use Equation 13 to compute their scalar triple product: a ? sb 3 cd - Z 1 2 0 4 21 29 27 4 18 Z - 1 Z 21 29 4 18 Z 2 4 Z 2 0 4 18 Z 2 7 Z 2 0 21 29 Z - 1s18d 2 4s36d 2 7s218d - 0 Therefore, by (14), the volume of the parallelepiped determined by a, b, and c is 0. This means that a, b, and c are coplanar. ■ The product a 3 sb 3 cd that occurs in Property 6 is called the vector triple product of a, b, and c. Property 6 will be used to derive Kepler’s First Law of planetary motion in Chapter 13. Its proof is left as Exercise 50. Torque The idea of a cross product occurs often in physics. In particular, we consider a force F acting on a rigid body at a point given by a position vector r. (For instance, if we tighten a bolt by applying a force to a wrench as in Figure 4, we produce a turning effect.) The torque t (relative to the origin) is deined to be the cross product of the position and force vectors t - r 3 F and measures the tendency of the body to rotate about the origin. The direction of the torque vector indicates the axis of rotation. According to Theorem 9, the magnitude of the torque vector is | t | - | r 3 F | - | r || F | sin  where  is the angle between the position and force vectors. Observe that the only com- ponent of F that can cause a rotation is the one perpendicular to r, that is, | F | sin . The magnitude of the torque is equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by r and F. EXAMPLE 6 A bolt is tightened by applying a 40-N force to a 0.25-m wrench as shown in Figure 5. Find the magnitude of the torque about the center of the bolt. r F  ¨ FIGURE 4 75° 40 N 0.25 m FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Lines A line in the xy-plane is determined when a point on the line and the direction of the line (its slope or angle of inclination) are given. The equation of the line can then be written using the point-slope form. Likewise, a line L in three-dimensional space is determined when we know a point P 0 s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d on L and the direction of L. In three dimensions the direction of a line is conveniently described by a vector, so we let v be a vector parallel to L. Let Ps x, y, zd be an arbitrary point on L and let r 0 and r be the position vectors of P 0 and P (that is, they have representations OP¸ A and OP l ). If a is the vector with representation P¸ P A, as in Fig- ure 1, then the Triangle Law for vector addition gives r - r 0 1 a. But, since a and v are parallel vectors, there is a scalar t such that a - t v. Thus x O z y a v r r¸ L P¸(x ¸, y¸, z¸) P(x, y, z) FIGURE 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","824 CHAPTER 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space 1 r - r 0 1 t v which is a vector equation of L. Each value of the parameter t gives the position vector r of a point on L. In other words, as t varies, the line is traced out by the tip of the vector r. As Figure 2 indicates, positive values of t correspond to points on L that lie on one side of P 0 , whereas negative values of t correspond to points that lie on the other side of P 0 . If the vector v that gives the direction of the line L is written in component form as v - k a, b, c l, then we have t v - k ta, tb, tc l . We can also write r - k x, y, z l and r 0 - k x 0 , y 0 , z 0 l , so the vector equation (1) becomes k x, y, z l - k x 0 1 ta, y 0 1 tb, z 0 1 tc l Two vectors are equal if and only if corresponding components are equal. Therefore we have the three scalar equations: x - x 0 1 at y - y 0 1 bt z - z 0 1 ct where t [ R. These equations are called parametric equations of the line L through the point P 0 s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d and parallel to the vector v - k a, b, cl. Each value of the parameter t gives a point s x, y, zd on L. 2 Parametric equations for a line through the point s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d and parallel to the direction vector ka, b, cl are x - x 0 1 at y - y 0 1 bt z - z 0 1 ct EXAMPLE 1 (a) Find a vector equation and parametric equations for the line that passes through the point s5, 1, 3d and is parallel to the vector i 1 4 j 2 2 k. (b) Find two other points on the line. SOLUTION (a) Here r 0 - k 5, 1, 3 l - 5 i 1 j 1 3 k and v - i 1 4 j 2 2 k, so the vector equa- tion (1) becomes r - s5 i 1 j 1 3 kd 1 t si 1 4 j 2 2 kd or r - s5 1 td i 1 s1 1 4td j 1 s3 2 2td k Parametric equations are x - 5 1 t y - 1 1 4t z - 3 2 2t (b) Choosing the parameter value t - 1 gives x - 6, y - 5, and z - 1, so s6, 5, 1d is a point on the line. Similarly, t - 21 gives the point s4, 23, 5d. ■ The vector equation and parametric equations of a line are not unique. If we change the point or the parameter or choose a different parallel vector, then the equations change. For instance, if, instead of s5, 1, 3d, we choose the point s6, 5, 1d in Example 1, then the parametric equations of the line become x - 6 1 t y - 5 1 4t z - 1 2 2t x z y L t=0 t>0 t<0 r¸ FIGURE 2 Figure 3 shows the line L in Example 1 and its relation to the given point and to the vector that gives its direction.

","SECTION 12.5 Equations of Lines and Planes 825 Or, if we stay with the point s5, 1, 3d but choose the parallel vector 2 i 1 8 j 2 4 k, we arrive at the equations x - 5 1 2t y - 1 1 8t z - 3 2 4t In general, if a vector v - k a, b, c l is used to describe the direction of a line L, then the numbers a, b, and c are called direction numbers of L. Since any vector parallel to v could also be used, we see that any three numbers proportional to a, b, and c could also be used as a set of direction numbers for L. Another way of describing a line L is to eliminate the parameter t from Equations 2. If none of a, b, or c is 0, we can solve each of these equations for t: t - x 2 x 0 a t - y 2 y 0 b t - z 2 z 0 c Equating the results, we obtain 3 x 2 x 0 a - y 2 y 0 b - z 2 z 0 c These equations are called symmetric equations of L. Notice that the numbers a, b, and c that appear in the denominators of Equations 3 are direction numbers of L, that is, components of a vector parallel to L. If one of a, b, or c is 0, we can still eliminate t. For instance, if a - 0, we could write the equations of L as x - x 0 y 2 y 0 b - z 2 z 0 c This means that L lies in the vertical plane x - x 0 . EXAMPLE 2 (a) Find parametric equations and symmetric equations of the line that passes through the points As2, 4, 23d and Bs3, 21, 1d. (b) At what point does this line intersect the xy-plane?

Taking the point s2, 4, 23d as P 0 , we see that parametric equations (2) are x - 2 1 t y - 4 2 5t z - 23 1 4t and symmetric equations (3) are x 2 2 1 - y 2 4 25 - z 1 3 4 (b) The line intersects the xy-plane when z - 0, so we put z - 0 in the symmetric equations and obtain x 2 2 1 - y 2 4 25 - 3 4 This gives x - 11 4 and y - 1 4 , so the line intersects the xy-plane at the point ( 11 4 , 1 4 , 0). ■ Figure 4 shows the line L in Example 2 and the point P where it intersects the xy-plane. x z y L A P B 2 4 1 1 _1 FIGURE 4 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","826 CHAPTER 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space In general, the procedure of Example 2 shows that direction numbers of the line L through the points P 0 s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d and P 1 s x 1 , y 1 , z 1 d are x 1 2 x 0 , y 1 2 y 0 , and z 1 2 z 0 and so symmetric equations of L are x 2 x 0 x 1 2 x 0 - y 2 y 0 y 1 2 y 0 - z 2 z 0 z 1 2 z 0 Often, we need a description, not of an entire line, but of just a line segment. How, for instance, could we describe the line segment AB in Example 2? If we put t - 0 in the parametric equations in Example 2(a), we get the point s2, 4, 23d and if we put t - 1 we get s3, 21, 1d. So the line segment AB is described by the parametric equations x - 2 1 t y - 4 2 5t z - 23 1 4t 0 < t < 1 or by the corresponding vector equation r s t d - k 2 1 t, 4 2 5t, 23 1 4 t l 0 < t < 1 In general, we know from Equation 1 that the vector equation of a line through the (tip of the) vector r 0 in the direction of a vector v is r - r 0 1 t v. If the line also passes through (the tip of) r 1 , then we can take v - r 1 2 r 0 and so its vector equation is r - r 0 1 t sr 1 2 r 0 d - s1 2 t d r 0 1 t r 1 The line segment from r 0 to r 1 is given by the parameter interval 0 < t < 1. 4 The line segment from r 0 to r 1 is given by the vector equation rstd - s1 2 tdr 0 1 t r 1 0 < t < 1 EXAMPLE 3 Show that the lines L 1 and L 2 with parametric equations L 1 : x - 1 1 t y - 22 1 3t z - 4 2 t L 2 : x - 2s y - 3 1 s z - 23 1 4s are skew lines; that is, they do not intersect and are not parallel (and therefore do not lie in the same plane). SOLUTION The lines are not parallel because the corresponding direction vectors k 1, 3, 21 l and k 2, 1, 4 l are not parallel. (Their components are not proportional.) If L 1 and L 2 had a point of intersection, there would be values of t and s such that 1 1 t - 2s 22 1 3t - 3 1 s 4 2 t - 23 1 4s But if we solve the irst two equations, we get t - 11 5 and s - 8 5 , and these values don’t satisfy the third equation. Therefore there are no values of t and s that satisfy the three equations, so L 1 and L 2 do not intersect. Thus L 1 and L 2 are skew lines. ■ Planes Although a line in space is determined by a point and a direction, a plane in space is more dificult to describe. A single vector parallel to a plane is not enough to convey the The lines L1 and L 2 in Example 3, shown in Figure 5, are skew lines. x z y L¡ L™ 5 _5 5 10 5 FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 12.5 Equations of Lines and Planes 827 “direction” of the plane, but a vector perpendicular to the plane does completely specify its direction. Thus a plane in space is determined by a point P 0 s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d in the plane and a vector n that is orthogonal to the plane. This orthogonal vector n is called a normal vector. Let Ps x, y, zd be an arbitrary point in the plane, and let r 0 and r be the position vectors of P 0 and P. Then the vector r 2 r 0 is represented by P¸ P A. (See Figure 6.) The normal vector n is orthogonal to every vector in the given plane. In particular, n is orthogonal to r 2 r 0 and so we have 5 n ? sr 2 r 0 d - 0 which can be rewritten as 6 n ? r - n ? r 0 Either Equation 5 or Equation 6 is called a vector equation of the plane. To obtain a scalar equation for the plane, we write n - k a, b, c l, r - k x, y, z l, and r 0 - k x 0 , y 0 , z 0 l . Then the vector equation (5) becomes k a, b, c l ? k x 2 x 0 , y 2 y 0 , z 2 z 0 l - 0 or as x 2 x 0 d 1 bs y 2 y 0 d 1 csz 2 z 0 d - 0 7 A scalar equation of the plane through point P 0 s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d with normal vector n - k a, b, c l is as x 2 x 0 d 1 bs y 2 y 0 d 1 csz 2 z 0 d - 0 EXAMPLE 4 Find an equation of the plane through the point s2, 4, 21d with normal vector n - k 2, 3, 4 l . Find the intercepts and sketch the plane. SOLUTION Putting a - 2, b - 3, c - 4, x 0 - 2, y 0 - 4, and z 0 - 21 in Equation 7, we see that an equation of the plane is 2s x 2 2d 1 3s y 2 4d 1 4sz 1 1d - 0 or 2 x 1 3y 1 4z - 12 T o ind the x-intercept we set y - z - 0 in this equation and obtain x - 6. Similarly, the y-intercept is 4 and the z-intercept is 3. This enables us to sketch the portion of the plane that lies in the irst octant (see Figure 7). ■ By collecting terms in Equation 7 as we did in Example 4, we can rewrite the equation of a plane as 8 ax 1 by 1 cz 1 d - 0 where d - 2sax 0 1 by 0 1 cz 0 d. Equation 8 is called a linear equation in x, y, and z. Conversely, it can be shown that if a, b, and c are not all 0, then the linear equation (8) represents a plane with normal vector k a, b, c l .

","828 CHAPTER 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space EXAMPLE 5 Find an equation of the plane that passes through the points Ps1, 3, 2d, Qs3, 21, 6d, and Rs5, 2, 0d. SOLUTION The vectors a and b corresponding to PQ l and PR l are a - k 2, 24, 4 l b - k 4, 21, 22 l Since both a and b lie in the plane, their cross product a 3 b is orthogonal to the plane and can be taken as the normal vector. Thus n - a 3 b - Z i 2 4 j 24 21 k 4 22 Z - 12 i 1 20 j 1 14 k With the point Ps1, 3, 2d and the normal vector n, an equation of the plane is 12s x 2 1d 1 20s y 2 3d 1 14sz 2 2d - 0 or 6x 1 10y 1 7z - 50 ■ EXAMPLE 6 Find the point at which the line with parametric equations x - 2 1 3t, y - 24t, z - 5 1 t intersects the plane 4x 1 5y 2 2z - 18. SOLUTION We substitute the expressions for x, y, and z from the parametric equations into the equation of the plane: 4s2 1 3t d 1 5s24t d 2 2s5 1 t d - 18 This simpliies to 210t - 20, so t - 22. Therefore the point of intersection occurs when the parameter value is t - 22. Then x - 2 1 3s22d - 24, y - 24s22d - 8, z - 5 2 2 - 3 and so the point of intersection is s24, 8, 3d. ■ Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel. For instance, the planes x 1 2y 2 3z - 4 and 2x 1 4y 2 6z - 3 are parallel because their normal vectors are n 1 - k 1, 2, 23 l and n 2 - k 2, 4, 26 l and n 2 - 2 n 1 . If two planes are not parallel, then they intersect in a straight line and the angle between the two planes is deined as the acute angle between their normal vectors (see angle  in Figure 9). EXAMPLE 7 (a) Find the angle between the planes x 1 y 1 z - 1 and x 2 2y 1 3z - 1. (b) Find symmetric equations for the line of intersection L of these two planes. SOLUTION (a) The normal vectors of these planes are n 1 - k 1, 1, 1l n 2 - k 1, 22, 3l and so, if  is the angle between the planes, Corollary 12.3.6 gives cos  - n 1 ? n 2 | n 1 || n 2 | - 1s1d 1 1s22d 1 1s3d s1 1 1 1 1 s1 1 4 1 9 - 2 s42  - cos 21 S 2 s42 D < 72° (b) We irst need to ind a point on L. For instance, we can ind the point where the line intersects the xy-plane by setting z - 0 in the equations of both planes. This gives the Figure 8 shows the portion of the plane in Example 5 that is enclosed by triangle PQR. x z y R(5, 2, 0) P (1, 3, 2) Q(3, _1, 6) FIGURE 8 ¨ n¡ n™ ¨ FIGURE 9 Figure 10 shows the planes in Example 7 and their line of intersection L. x-2y+3z=1 x+y+z=1 L z y x 6 4 2 0 _2 _4 0 2 _2 0 2 _2 FIGURE 10 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 12.5 Equations of Lines and Planes 829 equations x 1 y - 1 and x 2 2y - 1, whose solution is x - 1, y - 0. So the point s1, 0, 0d lies on L. Now we observe that, since L lies in both planes, it is perpendicular to both of the normal vectors. Thus a vector v parallel to L is given by the cross product v - n 1 3 n 2 - Z i 1 1 j 1 22 k 1 3 Z - 5 i 2 2 j 2 3 k and so the symmetric equations of L can be written as x 2 1 5 - y 22 - z 23 ■ NOTE Since a linear equation in x, y, and z represents a plane and two nonparallel planes intersect in a line, it follows that two linear equations can represent a line. The points s x, y, zd that satisfy both a 1 x 1 b 1 y 1 c 1 z 1 d 1 - 0 and a 2 x 1 b 2 y 1 c 2 z 1 d 2 - 0 lie on both of these planes, and so the pair of linear equations represents the line of inter- section of the planes (if they are not parallel). For instance, in Example 7 the line L was given as the line of intersection of the planes x 1 y 1 z - 1 and x 2 2y 1 3z - 1. The symmetric equations that we found for L could be written as x 2 1 5 - y 22 and y 22 - z 23 which is again a pair of linear equations. They exhibit L as the line of intersection of the planes s x 2 1dy5 - yys22d and yys22d - zys23d. (See Figure 11.) In general, when we write the equations of a line in the symmetric form x 2 x 0 a - y 2 y 0 b - z 2 z 0 c we can regard the line as the line of intersection of the two planes x 2 x 0 a - y 2 y 0 b and y 2 y 0 b - z 2 z 0 c Distances EXAMPLE 8 Find a formula for the distance D from a point P 1 s x 1 , y 1 , z 1 d to the plane ax 1 by 1 c z 1 d - 0. SOLUTION Let P 0 s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d be any point in the given plane and let b be the vector corresponding to P¸ P¡ A. Then b - k x 1 2 x 0 , y 1 2 y 0 , z 1 2 z 0 l From Figure 12 you can see that the distance D from P 1 to the plane is equal to the absolute value of the scalar projection of b onto the normal vector n - k a, b, c l . (See Section 12.3.) Thus D - | comp n b | - | n ? b | | n | - | as x 1 2 x 0 d 1 bs y 1 2 y 0 d 1 csz 1 2 z 0 d | sa 2 1 b 2 1 c 2 - | sax 1 1 by 1 1 c z 1 d 2 sax 0 1 by 0 1 c z 0 d | sa 2 1 b 2 1 c 2 Another way to ind the line of inter- section is to solve the equations of the planes for two of the variables in terms of the third, which can be taken as the parameter. y 2 z 3 = x-1 5 y _2 = z 0 y x 2 0 0 1 _2 _1 _1 1 2 1 _1 _2 L FIGURE 11 Figure 11 shows how the line L in Example 7 can also be regarded as the line of intersection of planes derived from its symmetric equations.

","830 CHAPTER 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space Since P 0 lies in the plane, its coordinates satisfy the equation of the plane and so we have ax 0 1 by 0 1 c z 0 1 d - 0. Thus the formula for D can be written as 9 D - | ax 1 1 by 1 1 c z 1 1 d | sa 2 1 b 2 1 c 2 ■ EXAMPLE 9 Find the distance between the parallel planes 10x 1 2y 2 2z - 5 and 5x 1 y 2 z - 1. SOLUTION First we note that the planes are parallel because their normal vectors k 10, 2, 22 l and k 5, 1, 21 l are parallel. T o ind the distance D between the planes, we choose any point on one plane and calculate its distance to the other plane. In par- ticular, if we put y - z - 0 in the equation of the irst plane, we get 10x - 5 and so ( 1 2 , 0, 0) is a point in this plane. By Formula 9, the distance between ( 1 2 , 0, 0) and the plane 5x 1 y 2 z 2 1 - 0 is D - | 5( 1 2 ) 1 1s0d 2 1s0d 2 1 | s5 2 1 1 2 1 s21d 2 - 3 2 3s3 - s3 6 So the distance between the planes is s3 y6. ■ EXAMPLE 10 In Example 3 we showed that the lines L 1 : x - 1 1 t y - 22 1 3t z - 4 2 t L 2 : x - 2s y - 3 1 s z - 23 1 4s are skew. Find the distance between them. SOLUTION Since the two lines L 1 and L 2 are skew, they can be viewed as lying on two parallel planes P 1 and P 2 . The distance between L 1 and L 2 is the same as the distance between P 1 and P 2 , which can be computed as in Example 9. The common normal vec- tor to both planes must be orthogonal to both v 1 - k 1, 3, 21l (the direction of L 1 ) and v 2 - k 2, 1, 4 l (the direction of L 2 ). So a normal vector is n - v 1 3 v 2 - Z i 1 2 j 3 1 k 21 4 Z - 13 i 2 6 j 2 5 k If we put s - 0 in the equations of L 2 , we get the point s0, 3, 23d on L 2 and so an equation for P 2 is 13s x 2 0d 2 6s y 2 3d 2 5sz 1 3d - 0 or 13x 2 6y 2 5z 1 3 - 0 If we now set t - 0 in the equations for L 1 , we get the point s1, 22, 4d on P 1 . So the distance between L 1 and L 2 is the same as the distance from s1, 22, 4d to 13x 2 6y 2 5z 1 3 - 0. By Formula 9, this distance is D - | 13s1d 2 6s22d 2 5s4d 1 3 | s13 2 1 s26d 2 1 s25d 2 - 8 s230 < 0.53 ■ FIGURE 13 Skew lines, like those in Example 10, always lie on (nonidentical) parallel planes.

To create the illusion of perspective, in which closer objects appear larger than those far- ther away, three-dimensional objects in the computer’s memory are projected onto a rectangular screen window from a viewpoint where the eye, or camera, is located. The viewing volume––the portion of space that will be visible––is the region contained by the four planes that pass through the viewpoint and an edge of the screen window. If objects in the scene extend beyond these four planes, they must be truncated before pixel data are sent to the screen. These planes are therefore called clipping planes. 1. Suppose the screen is represented by a rectangle in the yz-plane with vertices s0, 6400, 0d and s0, 6400, 600d, and the camera is placed at s1000, 0, 0d. A line L in the scene passes through the points s230, 2285, 102d and s860, 105, 264d. At what points should L be clipped by the clipping planes? 2. If the clipped line segment is projected onto the screen window, identify the resulting line segment. PUTTING 3D IN PERSPECTIVE Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Use parametric equations to plot the edges of the screen window, the clipped line segment, and its projection onto the screen window. Then add sight lines connecting the viewpoint to each end of the clipped segments to verify that the projection is correct. 4. A rectangle with vertices s621, 2147, 206d, s563, 31, 242d, s657, 2111, 86d, and s599, 67, 122d is added to the scene. The line L intersects this rectangle. To make the rect- angle appear opaque, a programmer can use hidden line rendering, which removes portions of objects that are behind other objects. Identify the portion of L that should be removed. We have already looked at two special types of surfaces: planes (in Section 12.5) and spheres (in Section 12.1). Here we investigate two other types of surfaces: cylinders and quadric surfaces. In order to sketch the graph of a surface, it is useful to determine the curves of inter- section of the surface with planes parallel to the coordinate planes. These curves are called traces (or cross-sections) of the surface. Cylinders A cylinder is a surface that consists of all lines (called rulings) that are parallel to a given line and pass through a given plane curve. EXAMPLE 1 Sketch the graph of the surface z - x 2 . SOLUTION Notice that the equation of the graph, z - x 2 , doesn’t involve y. This means that any vertical plane with equation y - k (parallel to the x z-plane) intersects the graph in a curve with equation z - x 2 . So these vertical traces are parabolas. Figure 1 shows how the graph is formed by taking the parabola z - x 2 in the x z-plane and mov- ing it in the direction of the y-axis. The graph is a surface, called a parabolic cylinder, made up of ininitely many shifted copies of the same parabola. Here the rulings of the cylinder are parallel to the y-axis. x y 0 z ■ We noticed that the variable y is missing from the equation of the cylinder in Exam- ple 1. This is typical of a surface whose rulings are parallel to one of the coordinate axes. If one of the variables x, y, or z is missing from the equation of a surface, then the surface is a cylinder. EXAMPLE 2 Identify and sketch the surfaces. (a) x 2 1 y 2 - 1 (b) y 2 1 z 2 - 1 FIGURE 1 The surface z - x 2 is a parabolic cylinder. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 12.6 Cylinders and Quadric Surfaces 835 SOLUTION (a) Since z is missing and the equations x 2 1 y 2 - 1, z - k represent a circle with radius 1 in the plane z - k, the surface x 2 1 y 2 - 1 is a circular cylinder whose axis is the z-axis. (See Figure 2.) Here the rulings are vertical lines. (b) In this case x is missing and the surface is a circular cylinder whose axis is the x-axis. (See Figure 3.) It is obtained by taking the circle y 2 1 z 2 - 1, x - 0 in the y z-plane and moving it parallel to the x-axis. ■ NOTE When you are dealing with surfaces, it is important to recognize that an equa- tion like x 2 1 y 2 - 1 represents a cylinder and not a circle. The trace of the cylinder x 2 1 y 2 - 1 in the xy-plane is the circle with equations x 2 1 y 2 - 1, z - 0. Quadric Surfaces A quadric surface is the graph of a second-degree equation in three variables x, y, and z. The most general such equation is Ax 2 1 By 2 1 Cz 2 1 Dxy 1 Ey z 1 Fx z 1 Gx 1 Hy 1 I z 1 J - 0 where A, B, C, . . . , J are constants, but by translation and rotation it can be brought into one of the two standard forms Ax 2 1 By 2 1 Cz 2 1 J - 0 or Ax 2 1 By 2 1 I z - 0 Quadric surfaces are the counterparts in three dimensions of the conic sections in the plane. (See Section 10.5 for a review of conic sections.) EXAMPLE 3 Use traces to sketch the quadric surface with equation x 2 1 y 2 9 1 z 2 4 - 1 SOLUTION By substituting z - 0, we ind that the trace in the xy-plane is x 2 1 y 2 y9 - 1, which we recognize as an equation of an ellipse. In general, the hori- zontal trace in the plane z - k is x 2 1 y 2 9 - 1 2 k 2 4 z - k which is an ellipse, provided that k 2 , 4, that is, 22 , k , 2. Similarly, vertical traces parallel to the y z- and x z-planes are also ellipses: y 2 9 1 z 2 4 - 1 2 k 2 x - k sif 21 , k , 1d x 2 1 z 2 4 - 1 2 k 2 9 y - k sif 23 , k , 3d Figure 4 shows how drawing some traces indicates the shape of the surface. It’s called an ellipsoid because all of its traces are ellipses. Notice that it is symmetric with respect to each coordinate plane; this is a relection of the fact that its equation involves only even powers of x, y, and z. ■ EXAMPLE 4 Use traces to sketch the surface z - 4x 2 1 y 2 . SOLUTION If we put x - 0, we get z - y 2 , so the y z-plane intersects the surface in a parabola. If we put x - k (a constant), we get z - y 2 1 4k 2 . This means that if we 0 z y x FIGURE 2 x 2 1 y 2 - 1 z y x FIGURE 3 y 2 1 z 2 - 1 (0, 3, 0) 0 (0, 0, 2) (1, 0, 0) x y z FIGURE 4 The ellipsoid x 2 1 y 2 9 1 z 2 4 - 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","836 CHAPTER 12 Vectors and the Geometry of Space slice the graph with any plane parallel to the y z-plane, we obtain a parabola that opens upward. Similarly, if y - k, the trace is z - 4x 2 1 k 2 , which is again a parabola that opens upward. If we put z - k, we get the horizontal traces 4x 2 1 y 2 - k, which we recognize as a family of ellipses. Knowing the shapes of the traces, we can sketch the graph in Figure 5. Because of the elliptical and parabolic traces, the quadric surface z - 4x 2 1 y 2 is called an elliptic paraboloid. ■ EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the surface z - y 2 2 x 2 . SOLUTION The traces in the vertical planes x - k are the parabolas z - y 2 2 k 2 , which open upward. The traces in y - k are the parabolas z - 2x 2 1 k 2 , which open downward. The horizontal traces are y 2 2 x 2 - k, a family of hyperbolas. We draw the families of traces in Figure 6, and we show how the traces appear when placed in their correct planes in Figure 7.

In most such software, traces in the vertical planes x - k and y - k are drawn for equally spaced values of k, and parts of the graph are eliminated using hidden line removal. Table 1 shows computer-drawn graphs of the six basic types of quadric surfaces in standard form. All surfaces are symmetric with respect to the z-axis.

","SECTION 12.6 Cylinders and Quadric Surfaces 839 Applications of Quadric Surfaces Examples of quadric surfaces can be found in the world around us. In fact, the world itself is a good example. Although the earth is commonly modeled as a sphere, a more accurate model is an ellipsoid because the earth’s rotation has caused a lattening at the poles. (See Exercise 49.) Circular paraboloids, obtained by rotating a parabola about its axis, are used to collect and relect light, sound, and radio and television signals. In a radio telescope, for instance, signals from distant stars that strike the bowl are all relected to the receiver at the focus and are therefore ampliied. (The idea is explained in Problem 22 on page 273.) The same principle applies to microphones and satellite dishes in the shape of paraboloids. Cooling towers for nuclear reactors are usually designed in the shape of hyperboloids of one sheet for reasons of structural stability. Pairs of hyperboloids are used to transmit rotational motion between skew axes. (The cogs of the gears are the generating lines of the hyperboloids. See Exercise 51.) David Frazier / Spirit / Corbis Mark C. Burnett / Science Source A satellite dish relects signals to the focus of a paraboloid. Nuclear reactors have cooling towers in the shape of hyperboloids. Hperboloids produce gear transmission. 1. (a) What does the equation y - x 2 represent as a curve in R 2 ? (b) What does it represent as a surface in R 3 ?

(This shows that the hyperbolic paraboloid is what is called a ruled surface; that is, it can be generated by the motion of a straight line. In fact, this exercise shows that through each point on the hyperbolic paraboloid there are two generating lines.

The box contains nine spherical balls with the same radius r. The center of one ball is at the center of the cube and it touches the other eight balls. Each of the other eight balls touches three sides of the box. Thus the balls are tightly packed in the box (see the igure). Find r.

Suppose a block of mass m is placed on an inclined plane, as shown in the igure. The block’s descent down the plane is slowed by friction; if  is not too large, friction will pre- vent the block from moving at all. The forces acting on the block are the weight W, where | W | - mt ( t is the acceleration due to gravity); the normal force N (the normal compo- nent of the reactionary force of the plane on the block), where | N | - n; and the force F due to friction, which acts parallel to the inclined plane, opposing the direction of motion. If the block is at rest and  is increased, | F | must also increase until ultimately | F | reaches its maximum, beyond which the block begins to slide. At this angle s, it has been observed that | F | is proportional to n. Thus, when | F | is maximal, we can say that | F | - s n, where s is called the coeficient of static friction and depends on the materials that are in contact.

","847 The paths of objects moving through space like the jet planes pictured here can be described by vector functions. In Section 13.1 we will see how to use these vector functions to determine whether or not two such objects will collide. THE FUNCTIONS THAT WE HAVE been using so far have been real-valued functions. We now study functions whose values are vectors because such functions are needed to describe curves and surfaces in space. We will also use vector-valued functions to describe the motion of objects through space. In particular, we will use them to derive Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. 13 © Natalia Davydenko / Shutterstock.com Vector Functions Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","848 CHAPTER 13 Vector Functions In general, a function is a rule that assigns to each element in the domain an element in the range. A vector-valued function, or vector function, is simply a function whose domain is a set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors. We are most inter- ested in vector functions r whose values are three-dimensional vectors. This means that for every number t in the domain of r there is a unique vector in V 3 denoted by rstd. If f std, tstd, and hstd are the components of the vector rstd, then f , t, and h are real-valued functions called the component functions of r and we can write rstd - k f std, tstd, hstdl - f std i 1 tstd j 1 hstd k We use the letter t to denote the independent variable because it represents time in most applications of vector functions. EXAMPLE 1 If rs t d - k t 3 , lns3 2 t d, st l then the component functions are f std - t 3 tstd - lns3 2 td hstd - st By our usual convention, the domain of r consists of all values of t for which the expres- sion for rstd is deined. The expressions t 3 , lns3 2 td, and st are all deined when 3 2 t . 0 and t > 0. Therefore the domain of r is the interval f0, 3d. ■ Limits and Continuity The limit of a vector function r is deined by taking the limits of its component functions as follows. 1 If rstd - k f std, tstd, hstdl, then lim t l a rstd - k lim t l a f std, lim t l a tstd, lim t l a hstd l provided the limits of the component functions exist. Equivalently, we could have used an «- deinition (see Exercise 54). Limits of vector functions obey the same rules as limits of real-valued functions (see Exercise 53). EXAMPLE 2 Find lim t l 0 rstd, where rstd - s1 1 t 3 d i 1 te 2t j 1 sin t t k. SOLUTION According to Deinition 1, the limit of r is the vector whose components are the limits of the component functions of r: lim t l 0 rstd - f lim t l 0 s1 1 t 3 d g i 1 f lim t l 0 te 2t g j 1 F lim t l 0 sin t t G k - i 1 k (by Equation 3.3.2) ■ If lim t la rstd - L, this deinition is equivalent to saying that the length and direction of the vector rstd approach the length and direction of the vector L.

","SECTION 13.1 Vector Functions and Space Curves 849 A vector function r is continuous at a if lim t l a rstd - rsad In view of Deinition 1, we see that r is continuous at a if and only if its component func- tions f , t, and h are continuous at a. Space Curves There is a close connection between continuous vector functions and space curves. Sup- pose that f , t, and h are continuous real-valued functions on an interval I . Then the set C of all points s x, y, zd in space, where 2 x - f std y - tstd z - hstd and t varies throughout the interval I, is called a space curve. The equations in (2) are called parametric equations of C and t is called a parameter. We can think of C as being traced out by a moving particle whose position at time t is s f std, tstd, hstdd. If we now consider the vector function rstd - k f std, tstd, hstdl, then rstd is the position vector of the point Ps f std, tstd, hstdd on C. Thus any continuous vector function r defines a space curve C that is traced out by the tip of the moving vector rstd, as shown in Figure 1. EXAMPLE 3 Describe the curve defined by the vector function rstd - k1 1 t, 2 1 5t, 21 1 6t l SOLUTION The corresponding parametric equations are x - 1 1 t y - 2 1 5t z - 21 1 6t which we recognize from Equations 12.5.2 as parametric equations of a line passing through the point s1, 2, 21d and parallel to the vector k1, 5, 6l. Alternatively, we could observe that the function can be written as r - r 0 1 t v, where r 0 - k1, 2, 21l and v - k 1, 5, 6 l, and this is the vector equation of a line as given by Equation 12.5.1. ■ Plane curves can also be represented in vector notation. For instance, the curve given by the parametric equations x - t 2 2 2t and y - t 1 1 (see Example 10.1.1) could also be described by the vector equation rstd - k t 2 2 2t, t 1 1l - st 2 2 2td i 1 st 1 1d j where i - k1, 0 l and j - k0, 1l. EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the curve whose vector equation is rstd - cos t i 1 sin t j 1 t k SOLUTION The parametric equations for this curve are x - cos t y - sin t z - t Since x 2 1 y 2 - cos 2 t 1 sin 2 t - 1 for all values of t, the curve must lie on the circular cylinder x 2 1 y 2 - 1. The point s x, y, zd lies directly above the point s x, y, 0d, which moves counterclockwise around the circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1 in the xy-plane. (The projection of the curve onto the xy-plane has vector equation r s t d - k cos t, sin t, 0 l. See Example 10.1.2.) Since z - t, the curve spirals upward around the cylinder as t increases. The curve, shown in Figure 2, is called a helix. ■ C 0 z x y P {f(t), g(t), h(t)} r(t)=k f(t), g(t), h(t)l FIGURE 1 C is traced out by the tip of a moving position vector rstd.

","850 CHAPTER 13 Vector Functions The corkscrew shape of the helix in Example 4 is familiar from its occurrence in coiled springs. It also occurs in the model of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic material of living cells). In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick showed that the struc- ture of the DNA molecule is that of two linked, parallel helixes that are intertwined as in Figure 3. In Examples 3 and 4 we were given vector equations of curves and asked for a geo- metric description or sketch. In the next two examples we are given a geometric descrip- tion of a curve and are asked to find parametric equations for the curve. EXAMPLE 5 Find a vector equation and parametric equations for the line segment that joins the point Ps1, 3, 22d to the point Qs2, 21, 3d. SOLUTION In Section 12.5 we found a vector equation for the line segment that joins the tip of the vector r 0 to the tip of the vector r 1 : r std - s1 2 td r 0 1 t r 1 0 < t < 1 (See Equation 12.5.4.) Here we take r 0 - k1, 3, 22 l and r 1 - k2, 21, 3l to obtain a vector equation of the line segment from P to Q: r std - s1 2 t d k1, 3, 22l 1 t k2, 21, 3l 0 < t < 1 or r std - k1 1 t, 3 2 4t, 22 1 5tl 0 < t < 1 The corresponding parametric equations are x - 1 1 t y - 3 2 4t z - 22 1 5t 0 < t < 1 ■ EXAMPLE 6 Find a vector function that represents the curve of intersection of the cylinder x 2 1 y 2 - 1 and the plane y 1 z - 2.

","SECTION 13.1 Vector Functions and Space Curves 851 The projection of C onto the xy-plane is the circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1, z - 0. So we know from Example 10.1.2 that we can write x - cos t y - sin t 0 < t < 2 From the equation of the plane, we have z - 2 2 y - 2 2 sin t So we can write parametric equations for C as x - cos t y - sin t z - 2 2 sin t 0 < t < 2 The corresponding vector equation is rstd - cos t i 1 sin t j 1 s2 2 sin td k 0 < t < 2 This equation is called a parametrization of the curve C. The arrows in Figure 6 indi- cate the direction in which C is traced as the parameter t increases. ■ Using Computers to Draw Space Curves Space curves are inherently more dificult to draw by hand than plane curves; for an accurate representation we need to use technology. For instance, Figure 7 shows a computer-generated graph of the curve with parametric equations x - s4 1 sin 20td cos t y - s4 1 sin 20td sin t z - cos 20t It’s called a toroidal spiral because it lies on a torus. Another interesting curve, the tre- foil knot, with equations x - s2 1 cos 1.5td cos t y - s2 1 cos 1.5td sin t z - sin 1.5t is graphed in Figure 8. It wouldn’t be easy to plot either of these curves by hand. z x y z x y FIGURE 7 FIGURE 8 A toroidal spiral A trefoil knot Even when a computer is used to draw a space curve, optical illusions make it dificult to get a good impression of what the curve really looks like. (This is especially true in Figure 8. See Exercise 52.) The next example shows how to cope with this problem. EXAMPLE 7 Use a computer to draw the curve with vector equation rstd - k t, t 2 , t 3 l . This curve is called a twisted cubic. SOLUTION We start by using the computer to plot the curve with parametric equations x - t, y - t 2 , z - t 3 for 22 < t < 2. The result is shown in Figure 9(a), but it’s hard to see the true nature of the curve from that graph alone. Most three-dimensional Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","852 CHAPTER 13 Vector Functions computer graphing programs allow the user to enclose a curve or surface in a box instead of displaying the coordinate axes. When we look at the same curve in a box in Figure 9(b), we have a much clearer picture of the curve. We can see that it climbs from a lower corner of the box to the upper corner nearest us, and it twists as it climbs. x z y 2 _2 2 4 6 _6 4 2 0 2 0 _6 _2 6 0 y z x _6 6 0 z 4 2 0 2 0 _2 y x 2 _2 0 x _1 1 0 1 2 3 4 y _8 8 0 z 4 _4 2 1 0 _1 _2 x _8 8 0 z 4 _4 0 1 2 3 4 y (a) (b) (c) (e) (d) (f) We get an even better idea of the curve when we view it from different vantage points. Part (c) shows the result of rotating the box to give another viewpoint. Parts (d), (e), and (f ) show the views we get when we look directly at a face of the box. In par- ticular, part (d) shows the view from directly above the box. It is the projection of the curve onto the xy-plane, namely, the parabola y - x 2 . Part (e) shows the projection onto the x z-plane, the cubic curve z - x 3 . It’s now obvious why the given curve is called a twisted cubic. ■ Another method of visualizing a space curve is to draw it on a surface. For instance, the twisted cubic in Example 7 lies on the parabolic cylinder y - x 2 . (Eliminate the parameter from the first two parametric equations, x - t and y - t 2 .) Figure 10 shows both the cylinder and the twisted cubic, and we see that the curve moves upward from the origin along the surface of the cylinder. We also used this method in Example 4 to visual- ize the helix lying on the circular cylinder (see Figure 2). z x y FIGURE 9 Views of the twisted cubic TEC In Visual 13.1B you can rotate the box in Figure 9 to see the curve from any viewpoint.

","SECTION 13.1 Vector Functions and Space Curves 853 A third method for visualizing the twisted cubic is to realize that it also lies on the cylinder z - x 3 .

Depend- ing on the initial velocity given the particle at the origin, the path of the particle is either a space curve whose projection onto the horizontal plane is the cycloid we studied in Section 10.1 [Figure 12(a)] or a curve whose projection is the trochoid investigated in Exercise 10.1.40 [Figure 12(b)].

Use the parametric equations x - s2 1 cos 1.5td cos t y - s2 1 cos 1.5td sin t z - sin 1.5t to sketch the curve by hand as viewed from above, with gaps indicating where the curve passes over itself. Start by showing that the projection of the curve onto the xy-plane has polar coordinates r - 2 1 cos 1.5t and  - t, so r varies between 1 and 3. Then show that z has maximum and minimum values when the projection is halfway between r - 1 and r - 3. When you have inished your sketch, use a computer to draw the curve with viewpoint directly above and compare with your sketch. Then use the computer to draw the curve from several other viewpoints.

If two objects travel through space along two different curves, it’s often important to know whether they will col- lide. (Will a missile hit its moving target? Will two aircraft collide?) The curves might intersect, but we need to know whether the objects are in the same position at the same time. Suppose the trajectories of two particles are given by the vector functions r1 s t d - k t 2 , 7t 2 12, t 2 l r2 s t d - k 4t 2 3, t 2 , 5t 2 6l for t > 0. Do the particles collide? 50.

The geometric signiicance of this deinition is shown in Figure 1. If the points P and Q have position vectors rstd and rst 1 hd, then PQ l represents the vec- tor rst 1 hd 2 rstd, which can therefore be regarded as a secant vector. If h . 0, the scalar multiple s1 yhdsrst 1 hd 2 rstdd has the same direction as rst 1 hd 2 rstd. As h l 0, it appears that this vector approaches a vector that lies on the tangent line. For this reason, the vector r9 std is called the tangent vector to the curve defined by r at the point P, provided that r9 std exists and r9 std ± 0. The tangent line to C at P is defined to be the line through P parallel to the tangent vector r9 std. We will also have occasion to consider the unit tangent vector, which is Tstd - r9 std | r9std | (b) The tangent vector rª(t) (a) The secant vector PQ 0 P C Q r(t+h)-r(t) r(t) r(t+h) 0 C P Q r(t+h) r(t) rª(t) y z x x z y r(t+h)-r(t) h The following theorem gives us a convenient method for computing the derivative of a vector function r: just differentiate each component of r. 2 Theorem If rstd - k f std, tstd, hstdl - f std i 1 tstd j 1 hstd k, where f , t, and h are differentiable functions, then r9 std - k f 9 std, t9 std, h9 stdl - f 9 std i 1 t9 std j 1 h9 std k PROOF r9 std - lim Dt l0 1 Dt frst 1Dtd 2 rstdg - lim Dt l0 1 Dt fk f st 1Dtd, tst 1Dtd, hst 1Dtdl 2 k f std, tstd, hstdlg - lim Dt l0 K f st 1Dtd 2 f std Dt , tst 1Dtd 2 tstd Dt , hst 1Dtd 2 hstd Dt L - K lim Dt l0 f st 1Dtd 2 f std Dt , lim Dt l0 tst 1Dtd 2 tstd Dt , lim Dt l0 hst 1Dtd 2 hstd Dt L - k f 9 std, t9 std, h9 stdl ■ dr dt - r9 std - lim h l 0 rst 1 hd 2 rstd h Notice that when 0 , h , 1, multiplying the secant vector by 1yh stretches the vector, as shown in Figure 1(b).

(See Figure 4.) ■ Integrals The deinite integral of a continuous vector function rstd can be deined in much the same way as for real-valued functions except that the integral is a vector.

SOLUTION Since r9 std - 2sin t i 1 cos t j 1 k, we have | r9 std | - ss2sin td 2 1 cos 2 t 1 1 - s2 The arc from s1, 0, 0d to s1, 0, 2d is described by the parameter interval 0 < t < 2 and so, from Formula 3, we have L - y 2 0 | r9 std | dt - y 2 0 s2 dt - 2 s2  ■ A single curve C can be represented by more than one vector function. For instance, the twisted cubic 4 r 1 std - k t, t 2 , t 3 l 1 < t < 2 could also be represented by the function 5 r 2 sud - k e u , e 2u , e 3u l 0 < u < ln 2 where the connection between the parameters t and u is given by t - e u . We say that Equations 4 and 5 are parametrizations of the curve C. If we were to use Equation 3 to com pute the length of C using Equations 4 and 5, we would get the same answer. In general, it can be shown that when Equation 3 is used to compute arc length, the answer is independent of the parametrization that is used. The Arc Length Function Now we suppose that C is a curve given by a vector function rstd - f std i 1 tstd j 1 hstd k a < t < b In the next section we will see that if rs t d is the position vector of a moving object at time t, then r9s t d is the velocity vector and | r9s t d | is the speed. Thus Equation 3 says that to compute dis- tance traveled, we integrate speed. (1, 0, 2π) z x y (1, 0, 0) Figure 2 shows the arc of the helix whose length is computed in Example 1.

","SECTION 13.3 Arc Length and Curvature 863 where r9 is continuous and C is traversed exactly once as t increases from a to b. We deine its arc length function s by 6 sstd - y t a | r9sud | du - y t a ÎS dx du D 2 1 S dy du D 2 1 S dz du D 2 du Thus sstd is the length of the part of C between rsad and rstd. (See Figure 3.) If we dif- ferentiate both sides of Equation 6 using Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we obtain 7 ds dt - | r9 std | It is often useful to parametrize a curve with respect to arc length because arc length arises naturally from the shape of the curve and does not depend on a particular coordinate system. If a curve rstd is already given in terms of a parameter t and sstd is the arc length function given by Equation 6, then we may be able to solve for t as a function of s: t - t ssd. Then the curve can be reparametrized in terms of s by substituting for t : r - rst ssdd. Thus, if s - 3 for instance, rst s3dd is the position vector of the point 3 units of length along the curve from its starting point. EXAMPLE 2 Reparametrize the helix rstd - cos t i 1 sin t j 1 t k with respect to arc length measured from s1, 0, 0d in the direction of increasing t. SOLUTION The initial point s1, 0, 0d corresponds to the parameter value t - 0. From Example 1 we have ds dt - | r9 std | - s2 and so s - sstd - y t 0 | r9 sud | du - y t 0 s2 du - s2 t Therefore t - sy s2 and the required reparametrization is obtained by substituting for t : rst ssdd - cosssy s2 d i 1 sinssy s2 d j 1 ssy s2 d k ■ Curvature A parametrization rstd is called smooth on an interval I if r9 is continuous and r9std ± 0 on I. A curve is called smooth if it has a smooth parametrization. A smooth curve has no sharp corners or cusps; when the tangent vector turns, it does so continuously. If C is a smooth curve deined by the vector function r, recall that the unit tangent vector Tstd is given by Tstd - r9 std | r9 std | and indicates the direction of the curve. From Figure 4 you can see that Tstd changes direction very slowly when C is fairly straight, but it changes direction more quickly when C bends or twists more sharply. The curvature of C at a given point is a measure of how quickly the curve changes direction at that point. Speciically, we deine it to be the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length. (We use arc length so that the curva- ture will be independent of the parametrization.) Because the unit tangent vector has constant length, only changes in direction contribute to the rate of change of T. z 0 x y C r(t) r(a) s(t) FIGURE 3 TEC Visual 13.3A shows animated unit tangent vectors, like those in Figure 4, for a variety of plane curves and space curves. z 0 x y C FIGURE 4 Unit tangent vectors at equally spaced points on C Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","864 CHAPTER 13 Vector Functions 8 Deinition The curvature of a curve is  - Z d T ds Z where T is the unit tangent vector. The curvature is easier to compute if it is expressed in terms of the parameter t instead of s, so we use the Chain Rule (Theorem 13.2.3, Formula 6) to write d T dt - d T ds ds dt and  - Z d T ds Z - Z d Tydt dsydt Z But dsydt - | r9 std | from Equation 7, so 9 std - | T9 std | | r9 std | EXAMPLE 3 Show that the curvature of a circle of radius a is 1 ya. SOLUTION We can take the circle to have center the origin, and then a parametrization is rstd - a cos t i 1 a sin t j Therefore r9 std - 2a sin t i 1 a cos t j and | r9 std | - a so Tstd - r9 std | r9 std | - 2sin t i 1 cos t j and T9 std - 2cos t i 2 sin t j This gives | T9 std | - 1, so using Formula 9, we have std - | T9 std | | r9 std | - 1 a ■ The result of Example 3 shows that small circles have large curvature and large circles have small curvature, in accordance with our intuition. We can see directly from the dei- nition of curvature that the curvature of a straight line is always 0 because the tangent vector is constant. Although Formula 9 can be used in all cases to compute the curvature, the formula given by the following theorem is often more convenient to apply. 10 Theorem The curvature of the curve given by the vector function r is std - | r9 std 3 r 0std | | r9 std | 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 13.3 Arc Length and Curvature 865 PROOF Since T - r9 y | r9 | and | r9 | - ds y dt, we have r9 - | r9 | T - ds dt T so the Product Rule (Theorem 13.2.3, Formula 3) gives r 0 - d 2 s dt 2 T 1 ds dt T9 Using the fact that T 3 T - 0 (see Example 12.4.2), we have r93 r 0 - S ds dt D 2 sT 3 T9d Now | Tstd | - 1 for all t, so T and T9 are orthogonal by Example 13.2.4.

At s2, 4d it is s2d - 2y17 3y2 < 0.03. Observe from the expression for s xd or the graph of  in Figure 5 that s xd l 0 as x l 6`. This corresponds to the fact that the parabola appears to become latter as x l 6`. ■ The Normal and Binormal Vectors At a given point on a smooth space curve rstd, there are many vectors that are orthogonal to the unit tangent vector Tstd. We single out one by observing that, because | Tstd | - 1 for all t, we have Tstd ? T9 std - 0 by Example 13.2.4, so T9 std is orthogonal to Tstd. Note that, typically, T9 std is itself not a unit vector. But at any point where  ± 0 we can deine the principal unit normal vector Nstd (or simply unit normal) as Nstd - T9 std | T9 std | We can think of the unit normal vector as indicating the direction in which the curve is turning at each point. The vector Bstd - Tstd 3 Nstd is called the binormal vector. It is perpendicular to both T and N and is also a unit vector. (See Figure 6.) EXAMPLE 6 Find the unit normal and binormal vectors for the circular helix rstd - cos t i 1 sin t j 1 t k SOLUTION We irst compute the ingredients needed for the unit normal vector: r9 std - 2sin t i 1 cos t j 1 k | r9 std | - s2 Tstd - r9 std | r9 std | - 1 s2 s2sin t i 1 cos t j 1 kd T9 std - 1 s2 s2cos t i 2 sin t jd | T9 std | - 1 s2 Nstd - T9 std | T9 std | - 2cos t i 2 sin t j - k2cos t, 2sin t, 0 l This shows that the normal vector at any point on the helix is horizontal and points toward the z-axis.

","SECTION 13.3 Arc Length and Curvature 867 The plane determined by the normal and binormal vectors N and B at a point P on a curve C is called the normal plane of C at P . It consists of all lines that are orthogonal to the tangent vector T. The plane determined by the vectors T and N is called the oscu- lating plane of C at P . The name comes from the Latin osculum, meaning “kiss.” It is the plane that comes closest to containing the part of the curve near P . (For a plane curve, the osculating plane is simply the plane that contains the curve.) The circle that lies in the osculating plane of C at P , has the same tangent as C at P , lies on the concave side of C (toward which N points), and has radius  - 1y  (the recip- rocal of the curvature) is called the osculating circle (or the circle of curvature) of C at P . It is the circle that best describes how C behaves near P; it shares the same tangent, normal, and curvature at P . EXAMPLE 7 Find equations of the normal plane and osculating plane of the helix in Example 6 at the point Ps0, 1, y2d.

In particular, we follow in the footsteps of Newton by using these methods to derive Kepler’s First Law of planetary motion. Suppose a particle moves through space so that its position vector at time t is rstd. Notice from Figure 1 that, for small values of h, the vector 1 rst 1 hd 2 rstd h approximates the direction of the particle moving along the curve rstd. Its magnitude mea- sures the size of the displacement vector per unit time. The vector (1) gives the average velocity over a time interval of length h and its limit is the velocity vector vstd at time t: 2 vstd - lim h l 0 rst 1 hd 2 rstd h - r9 std Thus the velocity vector is also the tangent vector and points in the direction of the tan- gent line. The speed of the particle at time t is the magnitude of the velocity vector, that is, | vstd | . This is appropriate because, from (2) and from Equation 13.3.7, we have | vstd | - | r9 std | - ds dt - rate of change of distance with respect to time r( t+h)-r(t) h O C P Q rª(t) r(t+h) r(t) x z y FIGURE 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The vector version of this law states that if, at any time t, a force Fstd acts on an object of mass m producing an acceleration astd, then Fstd - mastd EXAMPLE 4 An object with mass m that moves in a circular path with constant angular speed  has position vector rstd - a cos t i 1 a sin t j. Find the force acting on the object and show that it is directed toward the origin.

Where does the projectile hit the ground, and with what speed? SOLUTION If we place the origin at ground level, then the initial position of the projec- tile is (0, 10) and so we need to adjust Equations 4 by adding 10 to the expression for y. With v 0 - 150 my s,  - 45°, and t - 9.8 my s 2 , we have x - 150 coss45°d t - 75s2 t y - 10 1 150 sins45°d t 2 1 2 s9.8d t 2 - 10 1 75 s2 t 2 4.9t 2 Impact occurs when y - 0, that is, 4.9t 2 2 75s2 t 2 10 - 0.

If we write v - | v | for the speed of the particle, then Tstd - r9 std | r9 std | - vstd | vstd | - v v and so v - v T If we differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to t, we get 5 a - v9 - v9 T 1 v T9 If we use the expression for the curvature given by Equation 13.3.9, then we have 6  - | T9 | | r9 | - | T9 | v so | T9 | - v The unit normal vector was deined in the preceding section as N - T9 y | T9 | , so (6) gives T9 - | T9 | N - v N and Equation 5 becomes 7 a - v9 T 1 v 2 N Writing a T and a N for the tangential and normal components of acceleration, we have a - a T T 1 a N N where 8 a T - v9 and a N - v 2 This resolution is illustrated in Figure 7. Let’s look at what Formula 7 says. The irst thing to notice is that the binormal vector B is absent. No matter how an object moves through space, its acceleration always lies in the plane of T and N (the osculating plane). (Recall that T gives the direction of motion and N points in the direction the curve is turning.) Next we notice that the tangential component of acceleration is v9, the rate of change of speed, and the normal component of acceleration is v 2 , the curvature times the square of the speed. This makes sense if we think of a passenger in a car—a sharp turn in a road means a large value of the curvature , so the component of the acceleration perpendicular to the motion is large and the pas- senger is thrown against a car door. High speed around the turn has the same effect; in fact, if you double your speed, a N is increased by a factor of 4. a T a N N a T FIGURE 7 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

A planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus. 2. The line joining the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. 3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the length of the major axis of its orbit. In his book Principia Mathematica of 1687, Sir Isaac Newton was able to show that these three laws are consequences of two of his own laws, the Second Law of Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. In what follows we prove Kepler’s First Law. The remaining laws are left as exercises (with hints). Since the gravitational force of the sun on a planet is so much larger than the forces exerted by other celestial bodies, we can safely ignore all bodies in the universe except the sun and one planet revolving about it. We use a coordinate system with the sun at the origin and we let r - rstd be the position vector of the planet. (Equally well, r could be the position vector of the moon or a satellite moving around the earth or a comet moving around a star.) The velocity vector is v - r9 and the acceleration vector is a - r 0. We use the following laws of Newton: Second Law of Motion: F - ma Law of Gravitation: F - 2 GMm r 3 r - 2 GMm r 2 u where F is the gravitational force on the planet, m and M are the masses of the planet and the sun, G is the gravitational constant, r - | r | , and u - s1 yrd r is the unit vector in the direction of r. We irst show that the planet moves in one plane. By equating the expressions for F in Newton’s two laws, we ind that a - 2 GM r 3 r and so a is parallel to r. It follows that r 3 a - 0. We use Formula 5 in Theorem 13.2.3 to write d dt sr 3 vd - r93 v 1 r 3 v9 - v 3 v 1 r 3 a - 0 1 0 - 0 Therefore r 3 v - h where h is a constant vector. (We may assume that h ± 0; that is, r and v are not paral- lel.) This means that the vector r - rstd is perpendicular to h for all values of t, so the planet always lies in the plane through the origin perpendicular to h. Thus the orbit of the planet is a plane curve. To prove Kepler’s First Law we rewrite the vector h as follows: h - r 3 v - r 3 r9 - r u 3 sr ud9 - r u 3 sr u91 r 9 ud - r 2 su 3 u9d 1 rr 9 su 3 ud - r 2 su 3 u9d Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

At this point it is convenient to choose the coordinate axes so that the standard basis vector k points in the direction of the vector h. Then the planet moves in the xy-plane. Since both v 3 h and u are perpendicular to h, Equation 11 shows that c lies in the xy-plane. This means that we can choose the x- and y-axes so that the vector i lies in the direction of c, as shown in Figure 8. If  is the angle between c and r, then sr, d are polar coordinates of the planet.

We know that the orbit of a planet is a closed curve and so the conic must be an ellipse. This completes the derivation of Kepler’s First Law. We will guide you through the derivation of the Second and Third Laws in the Applied Project on page 880. The proofs of these three laws show that the methods of this chapter provide a powerful tool for describing some of the laws of nature. y z x u v r c h ¨ FIGURE 8 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

A medieval city has the shape of a square and is protected by walls with length 500 m and height 15 m. You are the commander of an attacking army and the closest you can get to the wall is 100 m. Your plan is to set ire to the city by catapulting heated rocks over the wall (with an initial speed of 80 my s). At what range of angles should you tell your men to set the catapult? (Assume the path of the rocks is perpendicular to the wall.) 30. Show that a projectile reaches three-quarters of its maxi- mum height in half the time needed to reach its maximum height. 31. A ball is thrown eastward into the air from the origin (in the direction of the positive x-axis). The initial velocity is 50 i 1 80 k, with speed measured in feet per second. The spin of the ball results in a southward acceleration of 4 fty s 2 , so the acceleration vector is a - 24 j 2 32 k. Where does the ball land and with what speed? 32. A ball with mass 0.8 kg is thrown southward into the air with a speed of 30 my s at an angle of 30° to the ground. A west wind applies a steady force of 4 N to the ball in an easterly direction. Where does the ball land and with what speed? 33. Water traveling along a straight portion of a river normally lows fastest in the middle, and the speed slows to almost zero at the banks. Consider a long straight stretch of river lowing north, with parallel banks 40 m apart. If the maxi- mum water speed is 3 mys, we can use a quadratic function as a basic model for the rate of water low x units from the west bank: f s xd - 3 400 x s40 2 xd. (a) A boat proceeds at a constant speed of 5 my s from a point A on the west bank while maintaining a heading perpendicular to the bank. How far down the river on the opposite bank will the boat touch shore? Graph the path of the boat. (b) Suppose we would like to pilot the boat to land at the point B on the east bank directly opposite A. If we maintain a constant speed of 5 my s and a constant head- ing, ind the angle at which the boat should head. Then graph the actual path the boat follows. Does the path seem realistic? 34. Another reasonable model for the water speed of the river in Exercise 33 is a sine function: f s xd - 3 sins xy40d. If a boater would like to cross the river from A to B with con- stant heading and a constant speed of 5 mys, determine the angle at which the boat should head. 35.

","880 CHAPTER 13 Vector Functions Johannes Kepler stated the following three laws of planetary motion on the basis of massive amounts of data on the positions of the planets at various times. Kepler’s Laws 1. A planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus. 2. The line joining the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. 3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the length of the major axis of its orbit. Kepler formulated these laws because they itted the astronomical data. He wasn’t able to see why they were true or how they related to each other. But Sir Isaac Newton, in his Principia Mathematica of 1687, showed how to deduce Kepler’s three laws from two of Newton’s own laws, the Second Law of Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. In Section 13.4 we proved Kepler’s First Law using the calculus of vector functions. In this project we guide you through the proofs of Kepler’s Second and Third Laws and explore some of their consequences. 1. Use the following steps to prove Kepler’s Second Law. The notation is the same as in the proof of the First Law in Section 13.4. In particular, use polar coordinates so that r - sr cos d i 1 sr sin d j. (a) Show that h - r 2 d dt k. (b) Deduce that r 2 d dt - h. (c) If A - Astd is the area swept out by the radius vector r - rstd in the time interval ft0, tg as in the igure, show that dA dt - 1 2 r 2 d dt (d) Deduce that dA dt - 1 2 h - constant This says that the rate at which A is swept out is constant and proves Kepler’s Second Law. 2. Let T be the period of a planet about the sun; that is, T is the time required for it to travel once around its elliptical orbit. Suppose that the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse are 2a and 2b. (a) Use part (d) of Problem 1 to show that T - 2abyh. (b) Show that h 2 GM - ed - b 2 a . (c) Use parts (a) and (b) to show that T 2 - 4 2 GM a 3 . This proves Kepler’s Third Law. [Notice that the proportionality constant 4 2 ysGMd is inde- pendent of the planet.] KEPLER’S LAWS APPLIED PROJECT 0 r(t) r(t¸) A(t) x y Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The period of the earth’s orbit is approximately 365.25 days. Use this fact and Kepler’s Third Law to ind the length of the major axis of the earth’s orbit.

An acceleration with this property is called a centripetal acceleration. Show that the magnitude of the acceleration vector is | a | - R 2 . (d) Suppose that the particle has mass m. Show that the magnitude of the force F that is required to produce this motion, called a centripetal force, is | F | - m | v | 2 R 2. A circular curve of radius R on a highway is banked at an angle  so that a car can safely traverse the curve without skidding when there is no friction between the road and the tires. The loss of friction could occur, for example, if the road is covered with a ilm of water or ice. The rated speed vR of the curve is the maximum speed that a car can attain without skidding. Suppose a car of mass m is traversing the curve at the rated speed vR. Two forces are acting on the car: the vertical force, mt, due to the weight of the car, and a force F exerted by, and normal to, the road (see the igure). The vertical component of F balances the weight of the car, so that | F | cos  - mt.

One problem he posed involved iring a projectile to hit a target a distance R up an inclined plane. Show that the angle at which the projectile should be ired to hit the target but use the least amount of energy is the same as the angle in part (c).

","888 CHAPTER 14 Partial Derivatives In this section we study functions of two or more variables from four points of view: ● verbally (by a description in words) ● numerically (by a table of values) ● algebraically (by an explicit formula) ● visually (by a graph or level curves) Functions of Two Variables The temperature T at a point on the surface of the earth at any given time depends on the longitude x and latitude y of the point. We can think of T as being a function of the two variables x and y, or as a function of the pair s x, yd. We indicate this functional dependence by writing T - f s x, yd. The volume V of a circular cylinder depends on its radius r and its height h. In fact, we know that V - r 2 h. We say that V is a function of r and h, and we write Vsr, hd - r 2 h. Deinition A function f of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers s x, yd in a set D a unique real number denoted by f s x, yd. The set D is the domain of f and its range is the set of values that f takes on, that is, h f s x, yd | s x, yd [ Dj. We often write z - f s x, yd to make explicit the value taken on by f at the general point s x, yd. The variables x and y are independent variables and z is the dependent variable. [Compare this with the notation y - f s xd for functions of a single variable.] A function of two variables is just a function whose domain is a subset of R 2 and whose range is a subset of R. One way of visualizing such a function is by means of an arrow diagram (see Figure 1), where the domain D is represented as a subset of the xy-plane and the range is a set of numbers on a real line, shown as a z-axis. For instance, if f s x, yd represents the temperature at a point s x, yd in a lat metal plate with the shape of D, we can think of the z-axis as a thermometer displaying the recorded temperatures. If a function f is given by a formula and no domain is speciied, then the domain of f is understood to be the set of all pairs s x, yd for which the given expression is a well- deined real number. EXAMPLE 1 For each of the following functions, evaluate f s3, 2d and ind and sketch the domain.

So the domain of f is D - hs x, yd | x 1 y 1 1 > 0, x ± 1j The inequality x 1 y 1 1 > 0, or y >2x 2 1, describes the points that lie on or y x 0 z D f( a, b) f( x, y) ( x, y) ( a, b) 0 FIGURE 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The function in the next example is described verbally and by numerical estimates of its values. EXAMPLE 2 In regions with severe winter weather, the wind-chill index is often used to describe the apparent severity of the cold. This index W is a subjective temperature that depends on the actual temperature T and the wind speed v. So W is a function of T and v, and we can write W - f sT, vd. Table 1 records values of W compiled by the US National Weather Service and the Meteorological Service of Canada.

They considered a simpliied view of the economy in which production output is determined by the amount of labor involved and the amount of capital invested. While there are many other factors affecting economic performance, their model proved to be remark- ably accurate. The function they used to model production was of the form 1 PsL, K d - bL  K 12 where P is the total production (the monetary value of all goods produced in a year), L is the amount of labor (the total number of person-hours worked in a year), and K is x 0 y _1 _1 x=1 x+y+1=0 FIGURE 2 Domain of f s x, yd - sx 1 y 1 1 x 2 1 x 0 y x=¥ FIGURE 3 Domain of f s x, yd - x lns y 2 2 xd The Wind-Chill Index The wind-chill index measures how cold it feels when it’s windy.

","890 CHAPTER 14 Partial Derivatives the amount of capital invested (the monetary worth of all machinery, equipment, and buildings). In Section 14.3 we will show how the form of Equation 1 follows from certain economic assumptions. Cobb and Douglas used economic data published by the government to obtain T able 2. They took the year 1899 as a baseline and P, L, and K for 1899 were each assigned the value 100. The values for other years were expressed as percentages of the 1899 igures. Cobb and Douglas used the method of least squares to it the data of Table 2 to the function 2 PsL, K d - 1.01L 0.75 K 0.25 (See Exercise 81 for the details.) If we use the model given by the function in Equation 2 to compute the production in the years 1910 and 1920, we get the values Ps147, 208d - 1.01s147d 0.75 s208d 0.25 < 161.9 Ps194, 407d - 1.01s194d 0.75 s407d 0.25 < 235.8 which are quite close to the actual values, 159 and 231. The production function (1) has subsequently been used in many settings, ranging from individual irms to global economics. It has become known as the Cobb-Douglas production function. Its domain is hsL, Kd | L > 0, K > 0j because L and K represent labor and capital and are therefore never negative. ■ EXAMPLE 4 Find the domain and range of ts x, yd - s9 2 x 2 2 y 2 . SOLUTION The domain of t is D - hs x, yd | 9 2 x 2 2 y 2 > 0j - hs x, yd | x 2 1 y 2 < 9j which is the disk with center s0, 0d and radius 3. (See Figure 4.)

Also, because 9 2 x 2 2 y 2 < 9, we have s9 2 x 2 2 y 2 < 3 So the range is h z | 0 < z < 3j - f0, 3g ■ Graphs Another way of visualizing the behavior of a function of two variables is to consider its graph. Deinition If f is a function of two variables with domain D, then the graph of f is the set of all points s x, y, zd in R 3 such that z - f s x, yd and s x, yd is in D. Just as the graph of a function f of one variable is a curve C with equation y - f s xd , so the graph of a function f of two variables is a surface S with equation z - f s x, yd. We can visualize the graph S of f as lying directly above or below its domain D in the xy-plane (see Figure 5).

In parts (a) and (b) the graph of f is very lat and close to the xy-plane except near the origin; this is because e 2x 2 2y 2 is very small when x or y is large. Level Curves So far we have two methods for visualizing functions: arrow diagrams and graphs. A third method, borrowed from mapmakers, is a contour map on which points of constant elevation are joined to form contour curves, or level curves. Deinition The level curves of a function f of two variables are the curves with equations f s x, yd - k, where k is a constant (in the range of f ). A level curve f s x, yd - k is the set of all points in the domain of f at which f takes on a given value k. In other words, it shows where the graph of f has height k. You can see from Figure 11 the relation between level curves and horizontal traces. The level curves f s x, yd - k are just the traces of the graph of f in the horizontal plane z - k projected down to the xy-plane. So if you draw the level curves of a function and visualize them being lifted up to the surface at the indicated height, then you can men- tally piece together a picture of the graph. The surface is steep where the level curves are close together. It is somewhat latter where they are farther apart. y x 0 z 45 k=35 k=40 k=20 k=25 k=30 k=45 f(x, y)=20 /21(620( 071 5000 4500 4500 4000 5 0 0 0 5500 L o n e s o m e C r e e k A B FIGURE 11 FIGURE 12 One common example of level curves occurs in topographic maps of mountainous regions, such as the map in Figure 12.

","SECTION 14.1 Functions of Several Variables 891 EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the function f s x, yd - 6 2 3x 2 2y. SOLUTION The graph of f has the equation z - 6 2 3x 2 2y, or 3x 1 2y 1 z - 6, which represents a plane. T o graph the plane we irst ind the intercepts. Putting y - z - 0 in the equation, we get x - 2 as the x-intercept. Similarly, the y-intercept is 3 and the z-intercept is 6. This helps us sketch the portion of the graph that lies in the irst octant in Figure 6. ■ The function in Example 5 is a special case of the function f s x, yd - ax 1 by 1 c which is called a linear function. The graph of such a function has the equation z - ax 1 by 1 c or ax 1 by 2 z 1 c - 0 so it is a plane. In much the same way that linear functions of one variable are important in single-variable calculus, we will see that linear functions of two variables play a cen- tral role in multivariable calculus. EXAMPLE 6 Sketch the graph of ts x, yd - s9 2 x 2 2 y 2 . SOLUTION The graph has equation z - s9 2 x 2 2 y 2 . We square both sides of this equation to obtain z 2 - 9 2 x 2 2 y 2 , or x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 - 9, which we recognize as an equation of the sphere with center the origin and radius 3. But, since z > 0, the graph of t is just the top half of this sphere (see Figure 7). ■ NOTE An entire sphere can’t be represented by a single function of x and y. As we saw in Example 6, the upper hemisphere of the sphere x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 - 9 is represented by the function ts x, yd - s9 2 x 2 2 y 2 . The lower hemisphere is represented by the function hs x, yd - 2s9 2 x 2 2 y 2 . EXAMPLE 7 Use a computer to draw the graph of the Cobb-Douglas production function PsL, K d - 1.01L 0.75 K 0.25 . SOLUTION Figure 8 shows the graph of P for values of the labor L and capital K that lie between 0 and 300. The computer has drawn the surface by plotting vertical traces. We see from these traces that the value of the production P increases as either L or K increases, as is to be expected. 0 100 200 300 L 100 0 200 300 K 0 100 200 300 ■ EXAMPLE 8 Find the domain and range and sketch the graph of hs x, yd - 4x 2 1 y 2 .

The isothermals are the curves that separate the colored bands. In weather maps of atmospheric pressure at a given time as a function of longitude and latitude, the level curves are called isobars and join locations with the same pres- sure. (See Exercise 34.) Surface winds tend to low from areas of high pressure across the isobars toward areas of low pressure, and are strongest where the isobars are tightly packed.

Figure 20 shows some computer-generated level curves together with the corre- sponding computer-generated graphs. Notice that the level curves in part (c) crowd together near the origin. That corresponds to the fact that the graph in part (d) is very steep near the origin. (a) Level curves of f(x, y)=_xye _≈_¥ x y (c) Level curves of f(x, y)= _3y ≈+¥+1 y x (d) f(x, y)= _3y ≈+¥+1 z y x (b) Two views of f(x, y)=_xye _≈_¥ z y x z Functions of Three or More Variables A function of three variables, f , is a rule that assigns to each ordered triple s x, y, zd in a domain D  R 3 a unique real number denoted by f s x, y, zd. For instance, the tempera- ture T at a point on the surface of the earth depends on the longitude x and latitude y of the point and on the time t, so we could write T - f s x, y, td.

","898 CHAPTER 14 Partial Derivatives EXAMPLE 14 Find the domain of f if f s x, y, zd - lnsz 2 yd 1 xy sin z SOLUTION The expression for f s x, y, zd is deined as long as z 2 y . 0, so the domain of f is D - hs x, y, zd [ R 3 | z . yj This is a half-space consisting of all points that lie above the plane z - y. ■ It’s very dificult to visualize a function f of three variables by its graph, since that would lie in a four-dimensional space. However, we do gain some insight into f by examining its level surfaces, which are the surfaces with equations f s x, y, zd - k, where k is a constant. If the point s x, y, zd moves along a level surface, the value of f s x, y, zd remains ixed. EXAMPLE 15 Find the level surfaces of the function f s x, y, zd - x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 SOLUTION The level surfaces are x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 - k, where k > 0. These form a family of concentric spheres with radius sk . (See Figure 21.) Thus, as s x, y, zd varies over any sphere with center O, the value of f s x, y, zd remains ixed. ■ Functions of any number of variables can be considered. A function of n vari- ables is a rule that assigns a number z - f s x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n d to an n-tuple s x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n d of real numbers. We denote by R n the set of all such n-tuples. For example, if a company uses n different ingredients in making a food product, c i is the cost per unit of the i th ingredient, and x i units of the i th ingredient are used, then the total cost C of the ingredi- ents is a function of the n variables x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n : 3 C - f s x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n d - c 1 x 1 1 c 2 x 2 1 ∙∙∙ 1 c n x n The function f is a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of R n . Sometimes we will use vector notation to write such functions more compactly: If x - kx 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n l, we often write f s xd in place of f s x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n d. With this notation we can rewrite the function deined in Equation 3 as f s xd - c ? x where c - k c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c n l and c ? x denotes the dot product of the vectors c and x in V n . In view of the one-to-one correspondence between points s x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n d in R n and their position vectors x - k x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n l in V n , we have three ways of looking at a func- tion f deined on a subset of R n : 1. As a function of n real variables x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n 2. As a function of a single point variable s x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n d 3. As a function of a single vector variable x - k x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n l We will see that all three points of view are useful. ≈+¥+z@=9 x y z ≈+¥+z@=1 ≈+¥+z@=4 FIGURE 21 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

It turns out that these guesses based on numerical evidence are correct, and we write lim s x, yd ls0, 0d sins x 2 1 y 2 d x 2 1 y 2 - 1 and lim s x, yd ls0, 0d x 2 2 y 2 x 2 1 y 2 does not exist In general, we use the notation lim s x, yd ls a, bd f s x, yd - L to indicate that the values of f s x, yd approach the number L as the point s x, yd approaches the point sa, bd along any path that stays within the domain of f . In other words, we can make the values of f s x, yd as close to L as we like by taking the point s x, yd sufficiently close to the point sa, bd, but not equal to sa, bd. A more precise definition follows. 1 Deinition Let f be a function of two variables whose domain D includes points arbitrarily close to sa, bd. Then we say that the limit of f s x, yd as sx, yd approaches s a, b d is L and we write lim s x, yd l sa, bd f s x, yd - L if for every number «. 0 there is a corresponding number  . 0 such that if s x, yd [ D and 0 , ss x 2 ad 2 1 s y 2 bd 2 ,  then | f s x, yd 2 L | ,« Other notations for the limit in Definition 1 are lim x l a y l b f s x, yd - L and f s x, yd l L as s x, yd l sa, bd Notice that | f s x, yd 2 L | is the distance between the numbers f s x, yd and L, and ss x 2 ad 2 1 s y 2 bd 2 is the distance between the point s x, yd and the point sa, bd.

If «. 0 is given, we can ind  . 0 such that if s x, yd is restricted to lie in the disk D  and s x, yd ± sa, bd, then the corresponding part of S lies between the horizontal planes z - L 2« and z - L 1«. For functions of a single variable, when we let x approach a, there are only two pos- sible directions of approach, from the left or from the right. We recall from Chapter 2 that if lim x la 2 f s xd ± lim x la 1 f s xd, then lim x l a f s xd does not exist. For functions of two variables the situation is not as simple because we can let s x, yd approach sa, bd from an ininite number of directions in any manner whatsoever (see Figure 3) as long as s x, yd stays within the domain of f . Definition 1 says that the distance between f s x, yd and L can be made arbitrarily small by making the distance from s x, yd to sa, bd sufficiently small (but not 0). The definition refers only to the distance between s x, yd and sa, bd. It does not refer to the direction of approach. Therefore, if the limit exists, then f s x, yd must approach the same limit no matter how s x, yd approaches sa, bd. Thus, if we can find two different paths of approach along which the function f s x, yd has different limits, then it follows that lim s x, yd l sa, bd f s x, yd does not exist. If f s x, yd l L 1 as s x, yd l sa, bd along a path C 1 and f s x, yd l L 2 as s x, yd l sa, bd along a path C 2 , where L 1 ± L 2 , then lim s x, yd l sa, bd f s x, yd does not exist.

Then y - 0 gives f s x, 0d - x 2 yx 2 - 1 for all x ± 0, so f s x, yd l 1 as s x, yd l s0, 0d along the x-axis We now approach along the y-axis by putting x - 0. Then f s0, yd - 2y 2 y 2 - 21 for all y ± 0, so f s x, yd l 21 as s x, yd l s0, 0d along the y-axis (See Figure 4.)

SOLUTION If y - 0, then f s x, 0d - 0yx 2 - 0. Therefore f s x, yd l 0 as s x, yd l s0, 0d along the x-axis If x - 0, then f s0, yd - 0yy 2 - 0, so f s x, yd l 0 as s x, yd l s0, 0d along the y-axis Although we have obtained identical limits along the axes, that does not show that the given limit is 0. Let’s now approach s0, 0d along another line, say y - x. For all x ± 0, f s x, xd - x 2 x 2 1 x 2 - 1 2 Therefore f s x, yd l 1 2 as s x, yd l s0, 0d along y - x (See Figure 5.) Since we have obtained different limits along different paths, the given limit does not exist. ■ Figure 6 sheds some light on Example 2.

SOLUTION With the solution of Example 2 in mind, let’s try to save time by letting s x, yd l s0, 0d along any line through the origin.

Just as for functions of one variable, the calcula- tion of limits for functions of two variables can be greatly simpliied by the use of prop- erties of limits. The Limit Laws listed in Section 2.3 can be extended to functions of two variables: the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, the limit of a product is the product of the limits, and so on. In particular, the following equations are true. 2 lim sx, yd lsa, bd x - a lim sx, yd lsa, bd y - b lim sx, yd lsa, bd c - c The Squeeze Theorem also holds. EXAMPLE 4 Find lim sx, yd ls0, 0d 3x 2 y x 2 1 y 2 if it exists. SOLUTION As in Example 3, we could show that the limit along any line through the origin is 0. This doesn’t prove that the given limit is 0, but the limits along the parabo- las y - x 2 and x - y 2 also turn out to be 0, so we begin to suspect that the limit does exist and is equal to 0.

Continuous functions of two variables are also deined by the direct substitution property. 4 Deinition A function f of two variables is called continuous at sa, bd if lim s x, yd lsa, bd f s x, yd - f sa, bd We say f is continuous on D if f is continuous at every point sa, bd in D. The intuitive meaning of continuity is that if the point s x, yd changes by a small amount, then the value of f s x, yd changes by a small amount. This means that a surface that is the graph of a continuous function has no hole or break. Using the properties of limits, you can see that sums, differences, products, and quo- tients of continuous functions are continuous on their domains. Let’s use this fact to give examples of continuous functions. A polynomial function of two variables (or polynomial, for short) is a sum of terms of the form cx m y n , where c is a constant and m and n are nonnegative integers. A rational function is a ratio of polynomials. For instance, f s x, yd - x 4 1 5x 3 y 2 1 6xy 4 2 7y 1 6 is a polynomial, whereas ts x, yd - 2xy 1 1 x 2 1 y 2 is a rational function. The limits in (2) show that the functions f s x, yd - x, ts x, yd - y, and hs x, yd - c are continuous. Since any polynomial can be built up out of the simple functions f , t, and h by multiplication and addition, it follows that all polynomials are continuous on R 2 . Likewise, any rational function is continuous on its domain because it is a quotient of continuous functions. EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate lim s x, yd ls1, 2d s x 2 y 3 2 x 3 y 2 1 3x 1 2yd. SOLUTION Since f s x, yd - x 2 y 3 2 x 3 y 2 1 3x 1 2y is a polynomial, it is continuous everywhere, so we can find the limit by direct substitution: lim s x, yd ls1, 2d s x 2 y 3 2 x 3 y 2 1 3x 1 2yd - 1 2 ? 2 3 2 1 3 ? 2 2 1 3 ? 1 1 2 ? 2 - 11 ■ EXAMPLE 6 Where is the function f s x, yd - x 2 2 y 2 x 2 1 y 2 continuous? SOLUTION The function f is discontinuous at s0, 0d because it is not defined there. Since f is a rational function, it is continuous on its domain, which is the set D - hs x, yd | s x, yd ± s0, 0dj. ■ EXAMPLE 7 Let ts x, yd - H 0 x 2 2 y 2 x 2 1 y 2 if if s x, yd ± s0, 0d s x, yd - s0, 0d Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 14.2 Limits and Continuity 909 Here t is deined at s0, 0d but t is still discontinuous there because lim s x, yd l s0, 0d ts x, yd does not exist (see Example 1). ■ EXAMPLE 8 Let f s x, yd - H 3x 2 y x 2 1 y 2 if sx, yd ± s0, 0d 0 if sx, yd - s0, 0d We know f is continuous for s x, yd ± s0, 0d since it is equal to a rational function there. Also, from Example 4, we have lim sx, yd l s0, 0d f sx, yd - lim sx, yd l s0, 0d 3x 2 y x 2 1 y 2 - 0 - f s0, 0d Therefore f is continuous at s0, 0d, and so it is continuous on R 2 . ■ Just as for functions of one variable, composition is another way of combining two continuous functions to get a third. In fact, it can be shown that if f is a continuous func- tion of two variables and t is a continuous function of a single variable that is deined on the range of f , then the composite function h - t 8 f deined by h sx, yd - ts f sx, ydd is also a continuous function. EXAMPLE 9 Where is the function hs x, yd - arctans yy xd continuous? SOLUTION The function f s x, yd - yy x is a rational function and therefore continuous except on the line x - 0. The function tstd - arctan t is continuous everywhere. So the composite function ts f s x, ydd - arctans yy xd - hs x, yd is continuous except where x - 0. The graph in Figure 9 shows the break in the graph of h above the y-axis. ■ Functions of Three or More Variables Everything that we have done in this section can be extended to functions of three or more variables. The notation lim s x, y, zd lsa, b, cd f s x, y, zd - L means that the values of f s x, y, zd approach the number L as the point s x, y, zd approaches the point sa, b, cd along any path in the domain of f . Because the distance between two points s x, y, zd and sa, b, cd in R 3 is given by ss x 2 ad 2 1 s y 2 bd 2 1 sz 2 cd 2 , we can write the precise deinition as follows: for every number «. 0 there is a corresponding number  . 0 such that if s x, y, zd is in the domain of f and 0 , ss x 2 ad 2 1 s y 2 bd 2 1 sz 2 cd 2 ,  then | f s x, y, zd 2 L | ,« The function f is continuous at sa, b, cd if lim s x, y, zd lsa, b, cd f s x, y, zd - f sa, b, cd z y x FIGURE 8 Figure 8 shows the graph of the continuous function in Example 8. _2 _1 0 1 2 x _2 _1 0 1 2 y _2 0 2 z FIGURE 9 The function hs x, yd - arctans yy xd is discontinuous where x - 0.

In other words, it is discontinuous on the sphere with center the origin and radius 1. If we use the vector notation introduced at the end of Section 14.1, then we can write the deinitions of a limit for functions of two or three variables in a single compact form as follows. 5 If f is deined on a subset D of R n , then lim x l a f sxd - L means that for every number «. 0 there is a corresponding number  . 0 such that if x [ D and 0 , | x 2 a | ,  then | f sxd 2 L | ,« Notice that if n - 1, then x - x and a - a, and (5) is just the deinition of a limit for functions of a single variable. For the case n - 2, we have x - k x, y l, a - k a, b l, and | x 2 a | - ss x 2 ad 2 1 s y 2 bd 2 , so (5) becomes Deinition 1. If n - 3, then x - k x, y, z l, a - k a, b, c l, and (5) becomes the deinition of a limit of a function of three variables.

The heat index I is the perceived air tempera- ture when the actual temperature is T and the relative humidity is H. So I is a function of T and H and we can write I - f sT, H d. The following table of values of I is an excerpt from a table compiled by the National Weather Service. Table 1 Heat index I as a function of temperature and humidity T H Relative humidity (%) Actual temperature (°F) 90 92 94 96 98 100 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 96 100 104 109 114 119 98 103 107 113 118 124 100 105 111 116 123 129 103 108 114 121 127 135 106 112 118 125 133 141 109 115 122 130 138 147 112 119 127 135 144 154 115 123 132 141 150 161 119 128 137 146 157 168 If we concentrate on the highlighted column of the table, which corresponds to a rela- tive humidity of H - 70%, we are considering the heat index as a function of the single variable T for a fixed value of H. Let’s write tsT d - f sT, 70d. Then tsT d describes how the heat index I increases as the actual temperature T increases when the relative humid- ity is 70%. The derivative of t when T - 968 F is the rate of change of I with respect to T when T - 968 F: t9 s96d - lim h l0 ts96 1 hd 2 ts96d h - lim h l0 f s96 1 h, 70d 2 f s96, 70d h We can approximate t9 s96d using the values in Table 1 by taking h - 2 and 22: t9 s96d< ts98d 2 ts96d 2 - f s98, 70d 2 f s96, 70d 2 - 133 2 125 2 - 4 t9 s96d< ts94d 2 ts96d 22 - f s94, 70d 2 f s96, 70d 22 - 118 2 125 22 - 3.5 Averaging these values, we can say that the derivative t9 s96d is approximately 3.75. This means that, when the actual temperature is 968 F and the relative humidity is 70%, the apparent temperature (heat index) rises by about 3.758 F for every degree that the actual temperature rises! Now let’s look at the highlighted row in Table 1, which corresponds to a fixed temper- ature of T - 968 F. The numbers in this row are values of the function GsH d - f s96, H d, which describes how the heat index increases as the relative humidity H increases when the actual temperature is T - 968 F. The derivative of this function when H - 70% is the rate of change of I with respect to H when H - 70%: G9 s70d - lim h l0 Gs70 1 hd 2 Gs70d h - lim h l0 f s96, 70 1 hd 2 f s96, 70d h Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This says that, when the temperature is 968 F and the relative humidity is 70%, the heat index rises about 0.98 F for every percent that the relative humidity rises. In general, if f is a function of two variables x and y, suppose we let only x vary while keeping y ixed, say y - b, where b is a constant. Then we are really considering a func- tion of a single variable x, namely, ts xd - f s x, bd. If t has a derivative at a, then we call it the partial derivative of f with respect to x at sa, bd and denote it by f x sa, bd. Thus 1 f x sa, bd - t9 sad where ts xd - f s x, bd By the deinition of a derivative, we have t9 sad - lim h l0 tsa 1 hd 2 tsad h and so Equation 1 becomes 2 f x sa, bd - lim h l0 f sa 1 h, bd 2 f sa, bd h Similarly, the partial derivative of f with respect to y at sa, bd, denoted by f y sa, bd, is obtained by keeping x ixed s x - ad and inding the ordinary derivative at b of the func- tion Gs yd - f sa, yd: 3 f y sa, bd - lim h l0 f sa, b 1 hd 2 f sa, bd h With this notation for partial derivatives, we can write the rates of change of the heat index I with respect to the actual temperature T and relative humidity H when T - 968 F and H - 70% as follows: f T s96, 70d< 3.75 f H s96, 70d< 0.9 If we now let the point sa, bd vary in Equations 2 and 3, f x and f y become functions of two variables.

","SECTION 14.3 Partial Derivatives 915 Interpretations of Partial Derivatives To give a geometric interpretation of partial derivatives, we recall that the equation z - f s x, yd represents a surface S (the graph of f ). If f sa, bd - c, then the point Psa, b, cd lies on S. By ixing y - b, we are restricting our attention to the curve C 1 in which the vertical plane y - b intersects S. (In other words, C 1 is the trace of S in the plane y - b.d Likewise, the vertical plane x - a intersects S in a curve C 2 . Both of the curves C 1 and C 2 pass through the point P. (See Figure 1.) Note that the curve C 1 is the graph of the function ts xd - f s x, bd, so the slope of its tan- gent T 1 at P is t9 sad - f x sa, bd. The curve C 2 is the graph of the function Gs yd - f sa, yd, so the slope of its tangent T 2 at P is G9 sbd - f y sa, bd. Thus the partial derivatives f x sa, bd and f y sa, bd can be interpreted geometrically as the slopes of the tangent lines at Psa, b, cd to the traces C 1 and C 2 of S in the planes y - b and x - a. As we have seen in the case of the heat index function, partial derivatives can also be interpreted as rates of change. If z - f s x, yd, then -zy-x represents the rate of change of z with respect to x when y is ixed. Similarly, -zy-y represents the rate of change of z with respect to y when x is ixed. EXAMPLE 2 If f s x, yd - 4 2 x 2 2 2y 2 , ind f x s1, 1d and f y s1, 1d and interpret these numbers as slopes.

(As in the preceding discussion, we label it C 1 in Figure 2.) The slope of the tangent line to this parabola at the point s1, 1, 1d is f x s1, 1d - 22. Similarly, the curve C 2 in which the plane x - 1 intersects the parabo- loid is the parabola z - 3 2 2y 2 , x - 1, and the slope of the tangent line at s1, 1, 1d is f y s1, 1d - 24. (See Figure 3.)

This is not just a coincidence. It turns out that the mixed partial derivatives f xy and f yx are equal for most functions that one meets in prac- tice. The following theorem, which was discovered by the French mathematician Alexis Clairaut (1713–1765), gives conditions under which we can assert that f xy - f yx . The proof is given in Appendix F. Clairaut’s Theorem Suppose f is deined on a disk D that contains the point sa, bd. If the functions f xy and f yx are both continuous on D, then f xy sa, bd - f yx sa, bd Clairaut Alexis Clairaut was a child prodigy in mathematics: he read l’Hospital’s text- book on calculus when he was ten and presented a paper on geometry to the French Academy of Sciences when he was 13. At the age of 18, Clairaut published Recherches sur les courbes à double courbure, which was the irst systematic treatise on three- dimensional analytic geometry and included the calculus of space curves. Partial derivatives of order 3 or higher can also be deined. For instance, f xyy - s f xy d y - - -y S - 2 f -y -x D - - 3 f -y 2 -x Figure 7 shows the graph of the function f in Example 7 and the graphs of its irst- and second-order partial derivatives for 22 < x < 2, 22 < y < 2. Notice that these graphs are consistent with our interpreta- tions of fx and fy as slopes of tangent lines to traces of the graph of f. For instance, the graph of f decreases if we start at s0, 22d and move in the positive x-direction. This is relected in the negative values of fx. You should compare the graphs of fyx and fyy with the graph of fy to see the relationships. FIGURE 7 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

For instance, the partial differential equation - 2 u -x 2 1 - 2 u -y 2 - 0 is called Laplace’s equation after Pierre Laplace (1749–1827). Solutions of this equa- tion are called harmonic functions; they play a role in problems of heat conduction, luid low, and electric potential. EXAMPLE 9 Show that the function us x, yd - e x sin y is a solution of Laplace’s equation. SOLUTION We irst compute the needed second-order partial derivatives: u x - e x sin y u y - e x cos y u xx - e x sin y u yy - 2e x sin y So u xx 1 u yy - e x sin y 2 e x sin y - 0 Therefore u satisies Laplace’s equation. ■ The wave equation - 2 u -t 2 - a 2 - 2 u -x 2 describes the motion of a waveform, which could be an ocean wave, a sound wave, a light wave, or a wave traveling along a vibrating string. For instance, if us x, td represents the displacement of a vibrating violin string at time t and at a distance x from one end of the string (as in Figure 8), then us x, td satisies the wave equation. Here the constant a depends on the density of the string and on the tension in the string. EXAMPLE 10 Verify that the function us x, td - sins x 2 atd satisies the wave equation.

","922 CHAPTER 14 Partial Derivatives The Cobb-Douglas Production Function In Example 14.1.3 we described the work of Cobb and Douglas in modeling the total production P of an economic system as a function of the amount of labor L and the capital investment K. Here we use partial derivatives to show how the particular form of their model follows from certain assumptions they made about the economy. If the production function is denoted by P - PsL, K d, then the partial derivative -P y-L is the rate at which production changes with respect to the amount of labor. Econ- omists call it the marginal production with respect to labor or the marginal productivity of labor. Likewise, the partial derivative -P y-K is the rate of change of production with respect to capital and is called the marginal productivity of capital. In these terms, the assumptions made by Cobb and Douglas can be stated as follows. (i) If either labor or capital vanishes, then so will production. (ii) The marginal productivity of labor is proportional to the amount of production per unit of labor. (iii) The marginal productivity of capital is proportional to the amount of produc- tion per unit of capital. Because the production per unit of labor is P yL, assumption (ii) says that -P -L -  P L for some constant . If we keep K constant sK - K 0 d, then this partial differential equa- tion becomes an ordinary differential equation: 6 dP dL -  P L If we solve this separable differential equation by the methods of Section 9.3 (see also Exercise 85), we get 7 PsL, K 0 d - C 1 sK 0 d L  Notice that we have written the constant C 1 as a function of K 0 because it could depend on the value of K 0 .

(a) Find -T y-x. What is its physical signiicance? ; One of the most important ideas in single-variable calculus is that as we zoom in toward a point on the graph of a differentiable function, the graph becomes indistinguishable from its tangent line and we can approximate the function by a linear function. (See Sec- tion 3.10.) Here we develop similar ideas in three dimensions. As we zoom in toward a point on a surface that is the graph of a differentiable function of two variables, the sur- face looks more and more like a plane (its tangent plane) and we can approximate the function by a linear function of two variables. We also extend the idea of a differential to functions of two or more variables. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

","928 CHAPTER 14 Partial Derivatives Tangent Planes Suppose a surface S has equation z - f s x, yd, where f has continuous irst partial deriva- tives, and let Ps x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d be a point on S. As in the preceding section, let C 1 and C 2 be the curves obtained by intersecting the vertical planes y - y 0 and x - x 0 with the sur- face S. Then the point P lies on both C 1 and C 2 . Let T 1 and T 2 be the tangent lines to the curves C 1 and C 2 at the point P . Then the tangent plane to the surface S at the point P is deined to be the plane that contains both tangent lines T 1 and T 2 . (See Figure 1.) We will see in Section 14.6 that if C is any other curve that lies on the surface S and passes through P , then its tangent line at P also lies in the tangent plane. Therefore you can think of the tangent plane to S at P as consisting of all possible tangent lines at P to curves that lie on S and pass through P . The tangent plane at P is the plane that most closely approximates the surface S near the point P . We know from Equation 12.5.7 that any plane passing through the point Ps x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d has an equation of the form As x 2 x 0 d 1 Bs y 2 y 0 d 1 Csz 2 z 0 d - 0 By dividing this equation by C and letting a - 2AyC and b - 2ByC, we can write it in the form 1 z 2 z 0 - as x 2 x 0 d 1 bs y 2 y 0 d If Equation 1 represents the tangent plane at P , then its intersection with the plane y - y 0 must be the tangent line T 1 . Setting y - y 0 in Equation 1 gives z 2 z 0 - as x 2 x 0 d where y - y 0 and we recognize this as the equation (in point-slope form) of a line with slope a. But from Section 14.3 we know that the slope of the tangent T 1 is f x s x 0 , y 0 d. Therefore a - f x s x 0 , y 0 d. Similarly, putting x - x 0 in Equation 1, we get z 2 z 0 - bs y 2 y 0 d, which must rep- resent the tangent line T 2 , so b - f y s x 0 , y 0 d. 2 Suppose f has continuous partial derivatives. An equation of the tangent plane to the surface z - f s x, yd at the point Ps x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d is z 2 z 0 - f x s x 0 , y 0 ds x 2 x 0 d 1 f y s x 0 , y 0 ds y 2 y 0 d EXAMPLE 1 Find the tangent plane to the elliptic paraboloid z - 2x 2 1 y 2 at the point s1, 1, 3d.

In Figure 3 we corroborate this impression by zooming in toward the point (1, 1) on a contour map of the function f s x, yd - 2x 2 1 y 2 . Notice that the more we zoom in, the more the level curves look like equally spaced parallel lines, which is characteristic of a plane. 0.95 1.05 1.05 0.8 1.2 1.2 0.5 1.5 1.5 Linear Approximations In Example 1 we found that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of the function f s x, yd - 2x 2 1 y 2 at the point s1, 1, 3d is z - 4x 1 2y 2 3. Therefore, in view of the visual evidence in Figures 2 and 3, the linear function of two variables Ls x, yd - 4x 1 2y 2 3 is a good approximation to f s x, yd when s x, yd is near s1, 1d. The function L is called the linearization of f at s1, 1d and the approximation f s x, yd< 4x 1 2y 2 3 is called the linear approximation or tangent plane approximation of f at s1, 1d. For instance, at the point s1.1, 0.95d the linear approximation gives f s1.1, 0.95d< 4s1.1d 1 2s0.95d 2 3 - 3.3 which is quite close to the true value of f s1.1, 0.95d - 2s1.1d 2 1 s0.95d 2 - 3.3225. But if we take a point farther away from s1, 1d, such as s2, 3d, we no longer get a good approximation. In fact, Ls2, 3d - 11 whereas f s2, 3d - 17.

","930 CHAPTER 14 Partial Derivatives In general, we know from (2) that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of a function f of two variables at the point sa, b, f sa, bdd is z - f sa, bd 1 f x sa, bds x 2 ad 1 f y sa, bds y 2 bd The linear function whose graph is this tangent plane, namely 3 Ls x, yd - f sa, bd 1 f x sa, bds x 2 ad 1 f y sa, bds y 2 bd is called the linearization of f at sa, bd and the approximation 4 f s x, yd< f sa, bd 1 f x sa, bds x 2 ad 1 f y sa, bds y 2 bd is called the linear approximation or the tangent plane approximation of f at sa, bd. We have deined tangent planes for surfaces z - f s x, yd, where f has continuous irst partial derivatives. What happens if f x and f y are not continuous? Figure 4 pictures such a function; its equation is f s x, yd - H 0 xy x 2 1 y 2 if if s x, yd ± s0, 0d s x, yd - s0, 0d You can verify (see Exercise 46) that its partial derivatives exist at the origin and, in fact, f x s0, 0d - 0 and f y s0, 0d - 0, but f x and f y are not continuous. The linear approximation would be f s x, yd< 0, but f s x, yd - 1 2 at all points on the line y - x. So a function of two variables can behave badly even though both of its partial derivatives exist. To rule out such behavior, we formulate the idea of a differentiable function of two variables. Recall that for a function of one variable, y - f s xd, if x changes from a to a 1Dx, we deined the increment of y as Dy - f sa 1Dxd 2 f sad In Chapter 3 we showed that if f is differentiable at a, then 5 Dy - f 9 sad Dx 1«Dx where « l 0 as Dx l 0 Now consider a function of two variables, z - f s x, yd, and suppose x changes from a to a 1Dx and y changes from b to b 1Dy. Then the corresponding increment of z is 6 Dz - f sa 1Dx, b 1Dyd 2 f sa, bd Thus the increment Dz represents the change in the value of f when s x, yd changes from sa, bd to sa 1Dx, b 1Dyd. By analogy with (5) we deine the differentiability of a func- tion of two variables as follows. 7 Deinition If z - f s x, yd, then f is differentiable at sa, bd if Dz can be expressed in the form Dz - f x sa, bd Dx 1 f y sa, bd Dy 1« 1 Dx 1« 2 Dy where « 1 and « 2 l 0 as sDx, Dyd l s0, 0d. Deinition 7 says that a differentiable function is one for which the linear approxima- tion (4) is a good approximation when s x, yd is near sa, bd. In other words, the tangent plane approximates the graph of f well near the point of tangency. z y x FIGURE 4 f s x, yd - xy x 2 1 y 2 if s x, yd ± s0, 0d, f s0, 0d - 0 This is Equation 3.4.7.

","SECTION 14.4 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations 931 It’s sometimes hard to use Deinition 7 directly to check the differentiability of a func- tion, but the next theorem provides a convenient suficient condition for differentiability. 8 Theorem If the partial derivatives f x and f y exist near sa, bd and are continuous at sa, bd, then f is differentiable at sa, bd.

The dif- ferential of y is then deined as 9 dy - f 9 s xd dx (See Section 3.10.) Figure 6 shows the relationship between the increment Dy and the differential dy : Dy represents the change in height of the curve y - f s xd and dy repre- sents the change in height of the tangent line when x changes by an amount dx - Dx. For a differentiable function of two variables, z - f s x, yd, we deine the differentials dx and dy to be independent variables; that is, they can be given any values. Then the differential dz, also called the total differential, is deined by 10 dz - f x s x, yd dx 1 f y s x, yd dy - -z -x dx 1 -z -y dy (Compare with Equation 9.) Sometimes the notation df is used in place of dz.

Use differentials to estimate the maximum error in the calculated volume of the cone. SOLUTION The volume V of a cone with base radius r and height h is V - r 2 hy3. So the differential of V is dV - -V -r dr 1 -V -h dh - 2rh 3 dr 1 r 2 3 dh Since each error is at most 0.1 cm, we have | Dr | < 0.1, | Dh | < 0.1. To estimate the largest error in the volume we take the largest error in the measurement of r and of h. Therefore we take dr - 0.1 and dh - 0.1 along with r - 10, h - 25. This gives dV - 500 3 s0.1d 1 100 3 s0.1d - 20 Thus the maximum error in the calculated volume is about 20 cm 3 < 63 cm 3 . ■ Functions of Three or More Variables Linear approximations, differentiability, and differentials can be deined in a similar manner for functions of more than two variables.

To estimate the largest error in the volume, we therefore use dx - 0.2, dy - 0.2, and dz - 0.2 together with x - 75, y - 60, and z - 40: DV < dV - s60ds40ds0.2d 1 s75ds40ds0.2d 1 s75ds60ds0.2d - 1980 Thus an error of only 0.2 cm in measuring each dimension could lead to an error of approximately 1980 cm 3 in the calculated volume!

One of the best known is the introduction, in 2008, of the Speedo LZR racer. It was claimed that this full-body swimsuit reduced a swimmer’s drag in the water. Figure 1 shows the number of world records broken in men’s and women’s long-course freestyle swimming events from 1990 to 2011. 1 The dramatic increase in 2008 when the suit was introduced led people to claim that such suits are a form of technological doping.

","SECTION 14.5 The Chain Rule 937 The speed v of an object being propelled through water is given by vsP, Cd - S 2P kC D 1y3 where P is the power being used to propel the object, C is the drag coeficient, and k is a positive constant. Athletes can therefore increase their swimming speeds by increasing their power or reducing their drag coeficients. But how effective is each of these? To compare the effect of increasing power versus reducing drag, we need to somehow com- pare the two in common units. The most common approach is to determine the percentage change in speed that results from a given percentage change in power and in drag. If we work with percentages as fractions, then when power is changed by a fraction x swith x corresponding to 100x percent), P changes from P to P 1 xP. Likewise, if the drag coeficient is changed by a fraction y, this means that it has changed from C to C 1 yC. Finally, the fractional change in speed resulting from both effects is 1 vsP 1 xP, C 1 yC d 2 vsP, C d vsP, C d 1. Expression 1 gives the fractional change in speed that results from a change x in power and a change y in drag. Show that this reduces to the function f s x, yd - S 1 1 x 1 1 y D 1y3 2 1 Given the context, what is the domain of f ? 2. Suppose that the possible changes in power x and drag y are small. Find the linear approxima- tion to the function f s x, yd. What does this approximation tell you about the effect of a small increase in power versus a small decrease in drag? 3. Calculate fxx s x, yd and fyys x, yd. Based on the signs of these derivatives, does the linear approximation in Problem 2 result in an overestimate or an underestimate for an increase in power? What about for a decrease in drag? Use your answer to explain why, for changes in power or drag that are not very small, a decrease in drag is more effective. 4. Graph the level curves of f s x, yd. Explain how the shapes of these curves relate to your answers to Problems 2 and 3. Courtesy Speedo and ANSYS, Inc. Recall that the Chain Rule for functions of a single variable gives the rule for differentiat- ing a composite function: If y - f s xd and x - tstd, where f and t are differentiable func- tions, then y is indirectly a differentiable function of t and 1 dy dt - dy dx dx dt For functions of more than one variable, the Chain Rule has several versions, each of them giving a rule for differentiating a composite function.

This means that z is indirectly a function of t, z - f s tstd, hstdd, and the Chain Rule gives a formula for differentiating z as a function of t. We assume that f Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Recall that this is the case when f x and f y are con- tinuous (Theorem 14.4.8). 2 The Chain Rule (Case 1) Suppose that z - f s x, yd is a differentiable func- tion of x and y, where x - tstd and y - hstd are both differentiable functions of t. Then z is a differentiable function of t and dz dt - -f -x dx dt 1 -f -y dy dt PROOF A change of Dt in t produces changes of Dx in x and Dy in y. These, in turn, produce a change of Dz in z, and from Deinition 14.4.7 we have Dz - -f -x Dx 1 -f -y Dy 1« 1 Dx 1« 2 Dy where « 1 l 0 and « 2 l 0 as sDx, Dyd l s0, 0d. [If the functions « 1 and « 2 are not deined at s0, 0d, we can deine them to be 0 there.] Dividing both sides of this equation by Dt, we have Dz Dt - -f -x Dx Dt 1 -f -y Dy Dt 1« 1 Dx Dt 1« 2 Dy Dt If we now let Dt l 0, then Dx - tst 1Dtd 2 tstd l 0 because t is differentiable and therefore continuous.

","SECTION 14.5 The Chain Rule 939 It’s not necessary to substitute the expressions for x and y in terms of t. We simply observe that when t - 0, we have x - sin 0 - 0 and y - cos 0 - 1. Therefore dz dt Z t-0 - s0 1 3ds2 cos 0d 1 s0 1 0ds2sin 0d - 6 ■ The derivative in Example 1 can be interpreted as the rate of change of z with respect to t as the point s x, yd moves along the curve C with parametric equations x - sin 2t, y - cos t. (See Figure 1.) In particular, when t - 0, the point s x, yd is s0, 1d and dzy dt - 6 is the rate of increase as we move along the curve C through s0, 1d. If, for instance, z - Ts x, yd - x 2 y 1 3xy 4 represents the temperature at the point s x, yd, then the com- posite function z - T ssin 2t, cos td represents the temperature at points on C and the derivative dzydt represents the rate at which the temperature changes along C. EXAMPLE 2 The pressure P (in kilopascals), volume V (in liters), and temperature T (in kelvins) of a mole of an ideal gas are related by the equation PV - 8.31T . Find the rate at which the pressure is changing when the temperature is 300 K and increasing at a rate of 0.1 Ky s and the volume is 100 L and increasing at a rate of 0.2 Ly s. SOLUTION If t represents the time elapsed in seconds, then at the given instant we have T - 300, dT ydt - 0.1, V - 100, dV ydt - 0.2. Since P - 8.31 T V the Chain Rule gives dP dt - -P -T dT dt 1 -P -V dV dt - 8.31 V dT dt 2 8.31T V 2 dV dt - 8.31 100 s0.1d 2 8.31s300d 100 2 s0.2d - 20.04155 The pressure is decreasing at a rate of about 0.042 kPays. ■ We now consider the situation where z - f s x, yd but each of x and y is a function of two variables s and t : x - tss, td, y - hss, td. Then z is indirectly a function of s and t and we wish to ind -zy-s and -zy-t. Recall that in computing -zy-t we hold s ixed and compute the ordinary derivative of z with respect to t. Therefore we can apply Theorem 2 to obtain -z -t - -z -x -x -t 1 -z -y -y -t A similar argument holds for -zy-s and so we have proved the following version of the Chain Rule. 3 The Chain Rule (Case 2) Suppose that z - f s x, yd is a differentiable func- tion of x and y, where x - tss, td and y - hss, td are differentiable functions of s and t. Then -z -s - -z -x -x -s 1 -z -y -y -s -z -t - -z -x -x -t 1 -z -y -y -t x (0, 1) y C FIGURE 1 The curve x - sin 2t, y - cos t Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Notice that Theorem 3 has one term for each intermediate variable and each of these terms resembles the one-dimensional Chain Rule in Equation 1. To remember the Chain Rule, it’s helpful to draw the tree diagram in Figure 2. We draw branches from the dependent variable z to the intermediate variables x and y to indicate that z is a function of x and y. Then we draw branches from x and y to the inde- pendent variables s and t. On each branch we write the corresponding partial derivative. To ind -zy-s, we ind the product of the partial derivatives along each path from z to s and then add these products: -z -s - -z -x -x -s 1 -z -y -y -s Similarly, we ind -zy-t by using the paths from z to t. Now we consider the general situation in which a dependent variable u is a function of n intermediate variables x 1 , ..., x n , each of which is, in turn, a function of m indepen- dent variables t 1 , ..., t m . Notice that there are n terms, one for each intermediate variable. The proof is similar to that of Case 1. 4 The Chain Rule (General Version) Suppose that u is a differentiable func- tion of the n variables x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n and each x j is a differentiable function of the m variables t 1 , t 2 , ..., t m . Then u is a function of t 1 , t 2 , ..., t m and -u -t i - -u -x 1 -x 1 -t i 1 -u -x 2 -x 2 -t i 1 ∙∙∙ 1 -u -x n -x n -t i for each i - 1, 2, ..., m. EXAMPLE 4 Write out the Chain Rule for the case where w - f s x, y, z, td and x - xsu, vd, y - ysu, vd, z - zsu, vd, and t - t su, vd. SOLUTION We apply Theorem 4 with n - 4 and m - 2. Figure 3 shows the tree dia- gram. Although we haven’t written the derivatives on the branches, it’s understood that if a branch leads from y to u, then the partial derivative for that branch is -yy-u. With the aid of the tree diagram, we can now write the required expressions: -w -u - -w -x -x -u 1 -w -y -y -u 1 -w -z -z -u 1 -w -t -t -u -w -v - -w -x -x -v 1 -w -y -y -v 1 -w -z -z -v 1 -w -t -t -v ■ z y x s t s t x s x t y t y s z x z y FIGURE 2 w y t x u v u v u v z u v FIGURE 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

We suppose that an equa- tion of the form Fs x, yd - 0 deines y implicitly as a differentiable function of x, that is, y - f s xd, where Fs x, f s xdd - 0 for all x in the domain of f . If F is differentiable, we can apply Case 1 of the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equation Fs x, yd - 0 with respect to x. Since both x and y are functions of x, we obtain -F -x dx dx 1 -F -y dy dx - 0 But dxydx - 1, so if -F y-y ± 0 we solve for dyydx and obtain 6 dy dx - 2 -F -x -F -y - 2 F x F y To derive this equation we assumed that Fs x, yd - 0 deines y implicitly as a function of x. The Implicit Function Theorem, proved in advanced calculus, gives conditions under which this assumption is valid: it states that if F is defined on a disk containing sa, bd, where Fsa, bd - 0, F y sa, bd ± 0, and F x and F y are continuous on the disk, then the equation Fs x, yd - 0 defines y as a function of x near the point sa, bd and the deriva- tive of this function is given by Equation 6. EXAMPLE 8 Find y9 if x 3 1 y 3 - 6xy.

","SECTION 14.5 The Chain Rule 943 Now we suppose that z is given implicitly as a function z - f s x, yd by an equation of the form Fs x, y, zd - 0. This means that Fs x, y, f s x, ydd - 0 for all s x, yd in the domain of f . If F and f are differentiable, then we can use the Chain Rule to differentiate the equation Fs x, y, zd - 0 as follows: -F -x -x -x 1 -F -y -y -x 1 -F -z -z -x - 0 But - -x s xd - 1 and - -x s yd - 0 so this equation becomes -F -x 1 -F -z -z -x - 0 If -F y-z ± 0, we solve for -zy-x and obtain the irst formula in Equations 7.

The level curves, or isothermals, join locations with the same temperature. The partial derivative T x at a loca- tion such as Reno is the rate of change of temperature with respect to distance if we travel east from Reno; T y is the rate of change of temperature if we travel north. But what if we want to know the rate of change of temperature when we travel southeast (toward Las Vegas), or in some other direction? In this section we introduce a type of derivative, called a directional derivative, that enables us to find the rate of change of a function of two or more variables in any direction. Directional Derivatives Recall that if z - f s x, yd, then the partial derivatives f x and f y are defined as 1 f x s x 0 , y 0 d - lim h l0 f s x 0 1 h, y 0 d 2 f s x 0 , y 0 d h f y s x 0 , y 0 d - lim h l0 f s x 0 , y 0 1 hd 2 f s x 0 , y 0 d h and represent the rates of change of z in the x- and y-directions, that is, in the directions of the unit vectors i and j. Suppose that we now wish to find the rate of change of z at s x 0 , y 0 d in the direction of an arbitrary unit vector u - k a, bl. (See Figure 2.) To do this we consider the surface S with the equation z - f s x, yd (the graph of f ) and we let z 0 - f s x 0 , y 0 d. Then the point Ps x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d lies on S.

By comparing Deinition 2 with Equations 1, we see that if u - i - k1, 0 l, then D i f - f x and if u - j - k 0, 1l, then D j f - f y . In other words, the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y are just special cases of the directional derivative. FIGURE 3 TEC Visual 14.6A animates Figure 3 by rotating u and therefore T.

The temperature at the point southeast of Reno is T - 60 8 F and the tempera- ture at the point northwest of Reno is T - 50 8 F. The distance between these points looks to be about 75 miles.

Let C be any curve that lies on the surface S and passes through the point P . Recall from Section 13.1 that the curve C is described by a continuous vector function rstd - k xstd, ystd, zstd l. Let t 0 be the parameter value corresponding to P; that is, rst 0 d - k x 0 , y 0 , z 0 l. Since C lies on S, any point s xstd, ystd, zstdd must satisfy the equation of S, that is, 16 Fs xstd, ystd, zstdd - k If x, y, and z are differentiable functions of t and F is also differentiable, then we can use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of Equation 16 as follows: 17 -F -x dx dt 1 -F -y dy dt 1 -F -z dz dt - 0 But, since =F - k F x , F y , F z l and r9 std - k x9 std, y9 std, z9 std l, Equation 17 can be written in terms of a dot product as =F ? r9 std - 0 In particular, when t - t 0 we have rst 0 d - k x 0 , y 0 , z 0 l, so 18 =Fs x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d ? r9 st 0 d - 0 Equation 18 says that the gradient vector at P , =Fs x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d, is perpendicular to the tangent vector r9 st 0 d to any curve C on S that passes through P .

Using the standard equation of a plane (Equation 12.5.7), we can write the equation of this tangent plane as 19 F x s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 ds x 2 x 0 d 1 F y s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 ds y 2 y 0 d 1 F z s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 dsz 2 z 0 d - 0 The normal line to S at P is the line passing through P and perpendicular to the tan- gent plane.

Then F x s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d - f x s x 0 , y 0 d F y s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d - f y s x 0 , y 0 d F z s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d - 21 0 S C ±F (x ¸, y¸, z¸) tangent plane P r ª(t¸) x z y FIGURE 9 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Thus our new, more general, deinition of a tangent plane is consistent with the deinition that was given for the special case of Section 14.4. EXAMPLE 8 Find the equations of the tangent plane and normal line at the point s22, 1, 23d to the ellipsoid x 2 4 1 y 2 1 z 2 9 - 3 SOLUTION The ellipsoid is the level surface (with k - 3) of the function Fs x, y, zd - x 2 4 1 y 2 1 z 2 9 Therefore we have F x s x, y, zd - x 2 F y s x, y, zd - 2y F z s x, y, zd - 2z 9 F x s22, 1, 23d - 21 F y s22, 1, 23d - 2 F z s22, 1, 23d - 2 2 3 Then Equation 19 gives the equation of the tangent plane at s22, 1, 23d as 21s x 1 2d 1 2s y 2 1d 2 2 3 sz 1 3d - 0 which simpliies to 3x 2 6y 1 2z 1 18 - 0. By Equation 20, symmetric equations of the normal line are x 1 2 21 - y 2 1 2 - z 1 3 2 2 3 ■ Significance of the Gradient Vector We now summarize the ways in which the gradient vector is signiicant. We irst consider a function f of three variables and a point Ps x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d in its domain. On the one hand, we know from Theorem 15 that the gradient vector = f s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d gives the direction of fastest increase of f . On the other hand, we know that = f s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d is orthogonal to the level surface S of f through P . (Refer to Figure 9.) These two properties are quite com- patible intuitively because as we move away from P on the level surface S, the value of f does not change at all. So it seems reasonable that if we move in the perpendicular direction, we get the maximum increase. In like manner we consider a function f of two variables and a point Ps x 0 , y 0 d in its domain. Again the gradient vector = f s x 0 , y 0 d gives the direction of fastest increase of f . Also, by considerations similar to our discussion of tangent planes, it can be shown that = f s x 0 , y 0 d is perpendicular to the level curve f s x, yd - k that passes through P . Again this is intuitively plausible because the values of f remain constant as we move along the curve. (See Figure 11.) If we consider a topographical map of a hill and let f s x, yd represent the height above sea level at a point with coordinates s x, yd, then a curve of steepest ascent can be drawn 4 2 0 -2 -4 -6 2 0 2 0 -2 y x z FIGURE 10 Figure 10 shows the ellipsoid, tangent plane, and normal line in Example 8. y 0 x P (x¸, y¸) level curve f(x, y)=k ±f(x¸, y¸) FIGURE 11 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In this section we see how to use partial derivatives to locate maxima and minima of functions of two variables. In particular, in Example 6 we will see how to maximize the volume of a box without a lid if we have a ixed amount of cardboard to work with. Look at the hills and valleys in the graph of f shown in Figure 1. There are two points sa, bd where f has a local maximum, that is, where f sa, bd is larger than nearby values of f s x, yd. The larger of these two values is the absolute maximum. Likewise, f has two local minima, where f sa, bd is smaller than nearby values. The smaller of these two val- ues is the absolute minimum. x z y absolute maximum absolute minimum local minimum local maximum FIGURE 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","960 CHAPTER 14 Partial Derivatives 1 Deinition A function of two variables has a local maximum at sa, bd if f s x, yd < f sa, bd when s x, yd is near sa, bd. [This means that f s x, yd < f sa, bd for all points s x, yd in some disk with center sa, bd.] The number f sa, bd is called a local maximum value. If f s x, yd > f sa, bd when s x, yd is near sa, bd, then f has a local minimum at sa, bd and f sa, bd is a local minimum value. If the inequalities in Deinition 1 hold for all points s x, yd in the domain of f , then f has an absolute maximum (or absolute minimum) at sa, bd. 2 Theorem If f has a local maximum or minimum at sa, bd and the irst-order partial derivatives of f exist there, then f x sa, bd - 0 and f y sa, bd - 0. PROOF Let ts xd - f s x, bd. If f has a local maximum (or minimum) at sa, bd, then t has a local maximum (or minimum) at a, so t9 sad - 0 by Fermat’s Theorem (see Theo- rem 4.1.4). But t9 sad - f x sa, bd (see Equation 14.3.1) and so f x sa, bd - 0. Similarly, by applying Fermat’s Theorem to the function Gs yd - f sa, yd, we obtain f y sa, bd - 0. ■ If we put f x sa, bd - 0 and f y sa, bd - 0 in the equation of a tangent plane (Equation 14.4.2), we get z - z 0 . Thus the geometric interpretation of Theorem 2 is that if the graph of f has a tangent plane at a local maximum or minimum, then the tangent plane must be horizontal. A point sa, bd is called a critical point (or stationary point) of f if f x sa, bd - 0 and f y sa, bd - 0, or if one of these partial derivatives does not exist. Theorem 2 says that if f has a local maximum or minimum at sa, bd, then sa, bd is a critical point of f . However, as in single-variable calculus, not all critical points give rise to maxima or minima. At a critical point, a function could have a local maximum or a local minimum or neither. EXAMPLE 1 Let f s x, yd - x 2 1 y 2 2 2x 2 6y 1 14. Then f x s x, yd - 2x 2 2 f y s x, yd - 2y 2 6 These partial derivatives are equal to 0 when x - 1 and y - 3, so the only critical point is s1, 3d. By completing the square, we ind that f s x, yd - 4 1 s x 2 1d 2 1 s y 2 3d 2 Since s x 2 1d 2 > 0 and s y 2 3d 2 > 0, we have f s x, yd > 4 for all values of x and y. Therefore f s1, 3d - 4 is a local minimum, and in fact it is the absolute minimum of f . This can be conirmed geometrically from the graph of f , which is the elliptic parabo- loid with vertex s1, 3, 4d shown in Figure 2. ■ EXAMPLE 2 Find the extreme values of f s x, yd - y 2 2 x 2 . SOLUTION Since f x - 22 x and f y - 2y, the only critical point is s0, 0d. Notice that for points on the x-axis we have y - 0, so f s x, yd - 2x 2 , 0 (if x ± 0). However, for points on the y-axis we have x - 0, so f s x, yd - y 2 . 0 (if y ± 0). Thus every disk with center s0, 0d contains points where f takes positive values as well as points where f takes negative values. Therefore f s0, 0d - 0 can’t be an extreme value for f , so f has no extreme value. ■ Notice that the conclusion of Theorem 2 can be stated in the notation of gradient vectors as =f sa, bd - 0. y x z 0 (1, 3, 4) FIGURE 2 z - x 2 1 y 2 2 2x 2 6y 1 14 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 14.7 Maximum and Minimum Values 961 Example 2 illustrates the fact that a function need not have a maximum or minimum value at a critical point. Figure 3 shows how this is possible. The graph of f is the hyper- bolic paraboloid z - y 2 2 x 2 , which has a horizontal tangent plane (z - 0) at the origin. You can see that f s0, 0d - 0 is a maximum in the direction of the x-axis but a minimum in the direction of the y-axis. Near the origin the graph has the shape of a saddle and so s0, 0d is called a saddle point of f . A mountain pass also has the shape of a saddle. As the photograph of the geologi- cal formation illustrates, for people hiking in one direction the saddle point is the lowest point on their route, while for those traveling in a different direction the saddle point is the highest point. We need to be able to determine whether or not a function has an extreme value at a critical point. The following test, which is proved at the end of this section, is analogous to the Second Derivative Test for functions of one variable. 3 Second Derivatives Test Suppose the second partial derivatives of f are continuous on a disk with center sa, bd, and suppose that f x sa, bd - 0 and f y sa, bd - 0 [that is, sa, bd is a critical point of f ]. Let D - Dsa, bd - f xx sa, bd f yy sa, bd 2 f f xy sa, bdg 2 (a) If D . 0 and f xx sa, bd . 0, then f sa, bd is a local minimum. (b) If D . 0 and f xx sa, bd , 0, then f sa, bd is a local maximum. (c) If D , 0, then f sa, bd is not a local maximum or minimum. NOTE 1 In case (c) the point sa, bd is called a saddle point of f and the graph of f crosses its tangent plane at sa, bd. NOTE 2 If D - 0, the test gives no information: f could have a local maximum or local minimum at sa, bd, or sa, bd could be a saddle point of f . NOTE 3 To remember the formula for D, it’s helpful to write it as a determinant: D - Z f xx f yx f xy f yy Z - f xx f yy 2 s f xy d 2 EXAMPLE 3 Find the local maximum and minimum values and saddle points of f s x, yd - x 4 1 y 4 2 4xy 1 1. SOLUTION We irst locate the critical points: f x - 4x 3 2 4y f y - 4y 3 2 4x Setting these partial derivatives equal to 0, we obtain the equations x 3 2 y - 0 and y 3 2 x - 0 To solve these equations we substitute y - x 3 from the irst equation into the second one. This gives 0 - x 9 2 x - x s x 8 2 1d - x s x 4 2 1ds x 4 1 1d - x s x 2 2 1ds x 2 1 1ds x 4 1 1d so there are three real roots: x - 0, 1, 21. The three critical points are s0, 0d, s1, 1d, and s21, 21d. z y x FIGURE 3 z - y 2 2 x 2 Photo by Stan Wagon, Macalester College Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Since Ds1, 1d - 128 . 0 and f xx s1, 1d - 12 . 0, we see from case (a) of the test that f s1, 1d - 21 is a local minimum. Similarly, we have Ds21, 21d - 128 . 0 and f xx s21, 21d - 12 . 0, so f s21, 21d - 21 is also a local minimum. The graph of f is shown in Figure 4. ■ y x 1 0.9 0.5 0 _0 .5 1.1 1.5 2 3 EXAMPLE 4 Find and classify the critical points of the function f s x, yd - 10x 2 y 2 5x 2 2 4y 2 2 x 4 2 2y 4 Also ind the highest point on the graph of f . SOLUTION The irst-order partial derivatives are f x - 20xy 2 10x 2 4x 3 f y - 10x 2 2 8y 2 8y 3 So to ind the critical points we need to solve the equations 4 2 x s10y 2 5 2 2 x 2 d - 0 5 5x 2 2 4y 2 4y 3 - 0 From Equation 4 we see that either x - 0 or 10y 2 5 2 2 x 2 - 0 In the irst case (x - 0), Equation 5 becomes 24ys1 1 y 2 d - 0, so y - 0 and we have the critical point s0, 0d. x y z FIGURE 4 z - x 4 1 y 4 2 4xy 1 1 A contour map of the function f in Example 3 is shown in Figure 5. The level curves near s1, 1d and s21, 21d are oval in shape and indicate that as we move away from s1, 1d or s21, 21d in any direction the values of f are increasing. The level curves near s0, 0d, on the other hand, resemble hyperbolas. They reveal that as we move away from the origin (where the value of f is 1), the values of f decrease in some directions but increase in other directions. Thus the contour map suggests the presence of the minima and saddle point that we found in Example 3.

","SECTION 14.7 Maximum and Minimum Values 963 In the second case s10y 2 5 2 2 x 2 - 0d, we get 6 x 2 - 5y 2 2.5 and, putting this in Equation 5, we have 25y 2 12.5 2 4y 2 4y 3 - 0. So we have to solve the cubic equation 7 4y 3 2 21y 1 12.5 - 0 Using a graphing calculator or computer to graph the function ts yd - 4y 3 2 21y 1 12.5 as in Figure 6, we see that Equation 7 has three real roots. By zooming in, we can ind the roots to four decimal places: y < 22.5452 y < 0.6468 y < 1.8984 (Alternatively, we could have used Newton’s method or solved numerically using a calculator or computer to locate these roots.) From Equation 6, the corresponding x-values are given by x - 6s5y 2 2.5 If y < 22.5452, then x has no corresponding real values. If y < 0.6468, then x < 60.8567. If y < 1.8984, then x < 62.6442. So we have a total of ive critical points, which are analyzed in the following chart. All quantities are rounded to two decimal places.

[This can also be seen from the expression for f s x, yd: the dominant terms are 2x 4 2 2y 4 when | x | and | y | are large.] Comparing the values of f at its local maxi- mum points, we see that the absolute maximum value of f is f s62.64, 1.90d< 8.50.

Intuitively, we can see that this local minimum is actually an absolute minimum because there must be a point on the given plane that is closest to s1, 0, 22d.

(Note that x and y must both be positive in this problem.) If we put x - y in either equation we get 12 2 3x 2 - 0, which gives x - 2, y - 2, and z - s12 2 2 ? 2dyf2s2 1 2dg - 1. We could use the Second Derivatives Test to show that this gives a local maximum of V, or we could simply argue from the physical nature of this problem that there must be an absolute maximum volume, which has to occur at a critical point of V, so it must occur when x - 2, y - 2, z - 1. Then V - 2 ? 2 ? 1 - 4, so the maximum volume of the box is 4 m 3 . ■ Absolute Maximum and Minimum Values For a function f of one variable, the Extreme Value Theorem says that if f is continuous on a closed interval fa, bg , then f has an absolute minimum value and an absolute maxi- mum value. According to the Closed Interval Method in Section 4.1, we found these by evaluating f not only at the critical numbers but also at the endpoints a and b. There is a similar situation for functions of two variables. Just as a closed interval contains its endpoints, a closed set in R 2 is one that contains all its boundary points. [A boundary point of D is a point sa, bd such that every disk with center sa, bd contains points in D and also points not in D.] For instance, the disk D - hs x, yd | x 2 1 y 2 < 1j which consists of all points on or inside the circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1, is a closed set because it contains all of its boundary points (which are the points on the circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1). But if even one point on the boundary curve were omitted, the set would not be closed. (See Figure 11.) A bounded set in R 2 is one that is contained within some disk. In other words, it is inite in extent. Then, in terms of closed and bounded sets, we can state the following counterpart of the Extreme Value Theorem in two dimensions. 8 Extreme Value Theorem for Functions of Two Variables If f is continu- ous on a closed, bounded set D in R 2 , then f attains an absolute maximum value f s x 1 , y 1 d and an absolute minimum value f s x 2 , y 2 d at some points s x 1 , y 1 d and s x 2 , y 2 d in D.

","966 CHAPTER 14 Partial Derivatives T o ind the extreme values guaranteed by Theorem 8, we note that, by Theorem 2, if f has an extreme value at s x 1 , y 1 d, then s x 1 , y 1 d is either a critical point of f or a boundary point of D. Thus we have the following extension of the Closed Interval Method. 9 To ind the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous func- tion f on a closed, bounded set D: 1. Find the values of f at the critical points of f in D. 2. Find the extreme values of f on the boundary of D. 3. The largest of the values from steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value. EXAMPLE 7 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function f s x, yd - x 2 2 2xy 1 2y on the rectangle D - hs x, yd | 0 < x < 3, 0 < y < 2j. SOLUTION Since f is a polynomial, it is continuous on the closed, bounded rectangle D, so Theorem 8 tells us there is both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. According to step 1 in (9), we irst ind the critical points. These occur when f x - 2x 2 2y - 0 f y - 22x 1 2 - 0 so the only critical point is s1, 1d, and the value of f there is f s1, 1d - 1. In step 2 we look at the values of f on the boundary of D, which consists of the four line segments L 1 , L 2 , L 3 , L 4 shown in Figure 12. On L 1 we have y - 0 and f s x, 0d - x 2 0 < x < 3 This is an increasing function of x, so its minimum value is f s0, 0d - 0 and its maxi- mum value is f s3, 0d - 9. On L 2 we have x - 3 and f s3, yd - 9 2 4y 0 < y < 2 This is a decreasing function of y, so its maximum value is f s3, 0d - 9 and its mini- mum value is f s3, 2d - 1. On L 3 we have y - 2 and f s x, 2d - x 2 2 4x 1 4 0 < x < 3 By the methods of Chapter 4, or simply by observing that f s x, 2d - s x 2 2d 2 , we see that the minimum value of this function is f s2, 2d - 0 and the maximum value is f s0, 2d - 4. Finally, on L 4 we have x - 0 and f s0, yd - 2y 0 < y < 2 with maximum value f s0, 2d - 4 and minimum value f s0, 0d - 0. Thus, on the boundary, the minimum value of f is 0 and the maximum is 9. In step 3 we compare these values with the value f s1, 1d - 1 at the critical point and conclude that the absolute maximum value of f on D is f s3, 0d - 9 and the absolute minimum value is f s0, 0d - f s2, 2d - 0.

","SECTION 14.7 Maximum and Minimum Values 967 We close this section by giving a proof of the irst part of the Second Derivatives Test. Part (b) has a similar proof. PROOF OF THEOREM 3, PART (a) We compute the second-order directional derivative of f in the direction of u - k h, k l. The irst-order derivative is given by Theorem 14.6.3: D u f - f x h 1 f y k Applying this theorem a second time, we have D 2 u f - D u sD u f d - - -x sD u f dh 1 - -y sD u f dk - s f xx h 1 f yx kdh 1 s f xy h 1 f yy kdk - f xx h 2 1 2 f xy hk 1 f yy k 2 (by Clairaut’s Theorem) If we complete the square in this expression, we obtain 10 D 2 u f - f xxS h 1 f xy f xx k D 2 1 k 2 f xx s f xx f yy 2 f 2 xy d We are given that f xx sa, bd . 0 and Dsa, bd . 0. But f xx and D - f xx f yy 2 f xy 2 are con- tinuous functions, so there is a disk B with center sa, bd and radius  . 0 such that f xx s x, yd . 0 and Ds x, yd . 0 whenever s x, yd is in B. Therefore, by looking at Equa- tion 10, we see that D u 2 f sx, yd . 0 whenever s x, yd is in B. This means that if C is the curve obtained by intersecting the graph of f with the vertical plane through Psa, b, f sa, bdd in the direction of u, then C is concave upward on an interval of length 2. This is true in the direction of every vector u, so if we restrict s x, yd to lie in B, the graph of f lies above its horizontal tangent plane at P . Thus f s x, yd > f sa, bd whenever s x, yd is in B. This shows that f sa, bd is a local minimum. ■ 1. Suppose s1, 1d is a critical point of a function f with contin- uous second derivatives.

The scientist performs an experiment and collects data in the form of points s x 1, y1d, s x 2, y2 d, ..., s x n, yn d, and then plots these points. The points don’t lie exactly on a straight line, so the scientist wants to ind constants m and b so that the line y - mx 1 b “its” the points as well as possible (see the igure).

APPLIED PROJECT DESIGNING A DUMPSTER The Taylor polynomial approximation to functions of one variable that we discussed in Chapter 11 can be extended to functions of two or more variables. Here we investigate qua- dratic approximations to functions of two variables and use them to give insight into the Second Derivatives Test for classifying critical points. In Section 14.4 we discussed the linearization of a function f of two variables at a point sa, bd: Ls x, yd - f sa, bd 1 fx sa, bds x 2 ad 1 fy sa, bds y 2 bd Recall that the graph of L is the tangent plane to the surface z - f s x, yd at sa, b, f sa, bdd and the corresponding linear approximation is f s x, yd< Ls x, yd. The linearization L is also called the irst-degree Taylor polynomial of f at sa, bd. DISCOVERY PROJECT QUADRATIC APPROXIMATIONS AND CRITICAL POINTS Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 14.8 Lagrange Multipliers 971 In Example 14.7.6 we maximized a volume function V - xy z subject to the constraint 2 x z 1 2y z 1 xy - 12, which expressed the side condition that the surface area was 12 m 2 . In this section we present Lagrange’s method for maximizing or minimizing a general function f s x, y, zd subject to a constraint (or side condition) of the form ts x, y, zd - k. It’s easier to explain the geometric basis of Lagrange’s method for functions of two variables. So we start by trying to ind the extreme values of f s x, yd subject to a con- straint of the form ts x, yd - k. In other words, we seek the extreme values of f s x, yd when the point s x, yd is restricted to lie on the level curve ts x, yd - k. Figure 1 shows this curve together with several level curves of f . These have the equations f s x, yd - c, where c - 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. To maximize f s x, yd subject to ts x, yd - k is to ind the largest value of c such that the level curve f s x, yd - c intersects ts x, yd - k. It appears from Figure 1 that this happens when these curves just touch each other, that is, when they have a common tangent line. (Otherwise, the value of c could be increased further.)

","972 CHAPTER 14 Partial Derivatives means that the normal lines at the point s x 0 , y 0 d where they touch are identical. So the gradient vectors are parallel; that is, = f s x 0 , y 0 d -  =ts x 0 , y 0 d for some scalar . This kind of argument also applies to the problem of finding the extreme values of f s x, y, zd subject to the constraint ts x, y, zd - k. Thus the point s x, y, zd is restricted to lie on the level surface S with equation ts x, y, zd - k. Instead of the level curves in Figure 1, we consider the level surfaces f s x, y, zd - c and argue that if the maximum value of f is f s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d - c, then the level surface f s x, y, zd - c is tangent to the level surface ts x, y, zd - k and so the corresponding gradient vectors are parallel. This intuitive argument can be made precise as follows. Suppose that a function f has an extreme value at a point Ps x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d on the surface S and let C be a curve with vector equation rs t d - k x s t d, y s t d, z s t dl that lies on S and passes through P . If t 0 is the parameter value corresponding to the point P, then rst 0 d - k x 0 , y 0 , z 0 l. The composite function hs t d - f s x s t d, y s t d, z s t dd represents the values that f takes on the curve C. Since f has an extreme value at s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d, it follows that h has an extreme value at t 0 , so h9 st 0 d - 0. But if f is differentiable, we can use the Chain Rule to write 0 - h9 st 0 d - f x s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d x9 st 0 d 1 f y s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 dy9 st 0 d 1 f z s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 dz9 st 0 d - = f s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d ? r9 st 0 d This shows that the gradient vector = f s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d is orthogonal to the tangent vector r9 st 0 d to every such curve C. But we already know from Section 14.6 that the gradient vector of t, =t s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d, is also orthogonal to r9 st 0 d for every such curve. (See Equation 14.6.18.) This means that the gradient vectors = f s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d and =t s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d must be parallel. Therefore, if =t s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d ± 0, there is a number  such that 1 = f s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d -  =t s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d The number  in Equation 1 is called a Lagrange multiplier. The procedure based on Equation 1 is as follows. Method of Lagrange Multipliers To find the maximum and minimum values of f s x, y, zd subject to the constraint t s x, y, zd - k [assuming that these extreme values exist and =t ± 0 on the surface t s x, y, zd - k]: (a) Find all values of x, y, z, and  such that = f s x, y, zd -  =t s x, y, zd and t s x, y, zd - k (b) Evaluate f at all the points s x, y, zd that result from step (a). The largest of these values is the maximum value of f ; the smallest is the minimum value of f . In deriving Lagrange’s method we assumed that =t ± 0. In each of our examples you can check that =t ± 0 at all points where ts x, y, zd - k. See Exercise 25 for what can go wrong if =t - 0. If we write the vector equation = f -  =t in terms of components, then the equations in step (a) become f x - t x f y - t y f z - t z t s x, y, zd - k Lagrange multipliers are named after the French-Italian mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813).

","SECTION 14.8 Lagrange Multipliers 973 This is a system of four equations in the four unknowns x, y, z, and , but it is not neces- sary to ind explicit values for . For functions of two variables the method of Lagrange multipliers is similar to the method just described. To ind the extreme values of f s x, yd subject to the constraint t s x, yd - k, we look for values of x, y, and  such that = f s x, yd -  =t s x, yd and t s x, yd - k This amounts to solving three equations in three unknowns: f x - t x f y - t y t s x, yd - k Our irst illustration of Lagrange’s method is to reconsider the problem given in Example 14.7.6. EXAMPLE 1 A rectangular box without a lid is to be made from 12 m 2 of cardboard. Find the maximum volume of such a box. SOLUTION As in Example 14.7.6, we let x, y, and z be the length, width, and height, respectively, of the box in meters. Then we wish to maximize V - xyz subject to the constraint t s x, y, zd - 2 x z 1 2y z 1 xy - 12 Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we look for values of x, y, z, and  such that =V -  =t and t s x, y, zd - 12. This gives the equations V x - t x V y - t y V z - t z 2 x z 1 2y z 1 xy - 12 which become 2 yz - s2z 1 yd 3 xz - s2z 1 xd 4 xy - s2x 1 2yd 5 2xz 1 2yz 1 xy - 12 There are no general rules for solving systems of equations. Sometimes some ingenuity is required. In the present example you might notice that if we multiply (2) by x, (3) by y, and (4) by z, then the left sides of these equations will be identical. Doing this, we have 6 xy z - s2 x z 1 xyd 7 xy z - s2y z 1 xyd 8 xy z - s2 x z 1 2y zd We observe that  ± 0 because  - 0 would imply y z - x z - xy - 0 from (2), (3), Another method for solving the system of equations (2–5) is to solve each of Equations 2, 3, and 4 for  and then to equate the resulting expressions.

Therefore, from (6) and (7), we have 2 x z 1 xy - 2y z 1 xy which gives x z - y z. But z ± 0 (since z - 0 would give V - 0), so x - y. From (7) and (8) we have 2y z 1 xy - 2 x z 1 2y z which gives 2 x z - xy and so (since x ± 0) y - 2z. If we now put x - y - 2z in (5), we get 4z 2 1 4z 2 1 4z 2 - 12 Since x, y, and z are all positive, we therefore have z - 1 and so x - 2 and y - 2. This agrees with our answer in Section 14.7. ■ EXAMPLE 2 Find the extreme values of the function f s x, yd - x 2 1 2y 2 on the circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1. SOLUTION We are asked for the extreme values of f subject to the constraint ts x, yd - x 2 1 y 2 - 1. Using Lagrange multipliers, we solve the equations = f -  =t and ts x, yd - 1, which can be written as f x - t x f y - t y ts x, yd - 1 or as 9 2x - 2x  10 4y - 2y  11 x 2 1 y 2 - 1 From (9) we have x - 0 or  - 1. If x - 0, then (11) gives y - 61. If  - 1, then y - 0 from (10), so then (11) gives x - 61. Therefore f has possible extreme values at the points s0, 1d, s0, 21d, s1, 0d, and s21, 0d. Evaluating f at these four points, we ind that f s0, 1d - 2 f s0, 21d - 2 f s1, 0d - 1 f s21, 0d - 1 Therefore the maximum value of f on the circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1 is f s0, 61d - 2 and the minimum value is f s61, 0d - 1. In geometric terms, these correspond to the highest and lowest points on the curve C in Figure 2, where C consists of those points on the paraboloid z - x 2 1 2y 2 that are directly above the constraint circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Find the extreme values of f s x, yd - x 2 1 2y 2 on the disk x 2 1 y 2 < 1. SOLUTION According to the procedure in (14.7.9), we compare the values of f at the critical points with values at the points on the boundary. Since f x - 2 x and f y - 4y, the only critical point is s0, 0d. We compare the value of f at that point with the extreme values on the boundary from Example 2: f s0, 0d - 0 f s61, 0d - 1 f s0, 61d - 2 Therefore the maximum value of f on the disk x 2 1 y 2 < 1 is f s0, 61d - 2 and the minimum value is f s0, 0d - 0. ■ The geometry behind the use of Lagrange multipliers in Example 2 is shown in Figure 3. The extreme values of f s x, yd - x 2 1 2y 2 correspond to the level curves that touch the circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1. x y 0 ≈+2¥=1 ≈+2¥=2 FIGURE 3 z x y ≈+¥=1 z=≈+2¥ C FIGURE 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

From (12) we have x 2 3 - x  or x s1 2 d - 3 or x - 3 1 2  [Note that 1 2  ± 0 because  - 1 is impossible from (12).] Similarly, (13) and (14) give y - 1 1 2  z - 2 1 1 2  Therefore, from (15), we have 3 2 s1 2 d 2 1 1 2 s1 2 d 2 1 s21d 2 s1 2 d 2 - 4 which gives s1 2 d 2 - 11 4 , 1 2  - 6s11 y2, so  - 1 6 s11 2 These values of  then give the corresponding points s x, y, zd: S 6 s11 , 2 s11 , 2 2 s11 D and S 2 6 s11 , 2 2 s11 , 2 s11 D It’s easy to see that f has a smaller value at the irst of these points, so the closest point is s6y s11 , 2y s11 , 22y s11 d and the farthest is s26y s11 , 22y s11 , 2y s11 d. ■ FIGURE 4 Figure 4 shows the sphere and the nearest point P in Example 4.

","976 CHAPTER 14 Partial Derivatives Two Constraints Suppose now that we want to ind the maximum and minimum values of a function f s x, y, zd subject to two constraints (side conditions) of the form ts x, y, zd - k and hs x, y, zd - c. Geometrically, this means that we are looking for the extreme values of f when s x, y, zd is restricted to lie on the curve of intersection C of the level surfaces ts x, y, zd - k and hs x, y, zd - c. (See Figure 5.) Suppose f has such an extreme value at a point Ps x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d. We know from the beginning of this section that = f is orthogonal to C at P . But we also know that =t is orthogonal to ts x, y, zd - k and =h is orthogonal to hs x, y, zd - c, so =t and =h are both orthogonal to C. This means that the gradient vector = f s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d is in the plane determined by =ts x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d and =hs x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d. (We assume that these gradient vectors are not zero and not parallel.) So there are numbers  and  (called Lagrange multipliers) such that 16 = f s x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d -  =ts x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d 1  =hs x 0 , y 0 , z 0 d In this case Lagrange’s method is to look for extreme values by solving five equations in the five unknowns x, y, z, , and . These equations are obtained by writing Equation 16 in terms of its components and using the constraint equations: f x -  t x 1 h x f y -  t y 1 h y f z -  t z 1 h z ts x, y, zd - k hs x, y, zd - c EXAMPLE 5 Find the maximum value of the function f s x, y, zd - x 1 2y 1 3z on the curve of intersection of the plane x 2 y 1 z - 1 and the cylinder x 2 1 y 2 - 1.

","APPLIED PROJECT Rocket Science 979 APPLIED PROJECT Many rockets, such as the Pegasus XL currently used to launch satellites and the Saturn V that irst put men on the moon, are designed to use three stages in their ascent into space. A large irst stage initially propels the rocket until its fuel is consumed, at which point the stage is jettisoned to reduce the mass of the rocket. The smaller second and third stages function similarly in order to place the rocket’s payload into orbit about the earth. (With this design, at least two stages are required in order to reach the necessary velocities, and using three stages has proven to be a good compromise between cost and performance.) Our goal here is to determine the individual masses of the three stages, which are to be designed to minimize the total mass of the rocket while enabling it to reach a desired velocity. For a single-stage rocket consuming fuel at a constant rate, the change in velocity resulting from the acceleration of the rocket vehicle has been modeled by DV - 2c ln S 1 2 s1 2 SdMr P 1 Mr D where Mr is the mass of the rocket engine including initial fuel, P is the mass of the payload, S is a structural factor determined by the design of the rocket (speciically, it is the ratio of the mass of the rocket vehicle without fuel to the total mass of the rocket with payload), and c is the (constant) speed of exhaust relative to the rocket. Now consider a rocket with three stages and a payload of mass A. Assume that outside forces are negligible and that c and S remain constant for each stage. If Mi is the mass of the i th stage, we can initially consider the rocket engine to have mass M1 and its payload to have mass M2 1 M3 1 A; the second and third stages can be handled similarly. 1. Show that the velocity attained after all three stages have been jettisoned is given by v f - c F ln S M1 1 M2 1 M3 1 A SM1 1 M2 1 M3 1 A D 1 ln S M2 1 M3 1 A SM2 1 M3 1 A D 1 ln S M3 1 A SM3 1 A DG 2. We wish to minimize the total mass M - M1 1 M2 1 M3 of the rocket engine subject to the constraint that the desired velocity v f from Problem 1 is attained. The method of Lagrange multipliers is appropriate here, but dificult to implement using the current expres- sions. To simplify, we deine variables Ni so that the constraint equation may be expressed as v f - csln N1 1 ln N2 1 ln N3 d. Since M is now dificult to express in terms of the Ni’s, we wish to use a simpler function that will be minimized at the same place as M. Show that M1 1 M2 1 M3 1 A M2 1 M3 1 A - s1 2 S dN1 1 2 SN1 M2 1 M3 1 A M3 1 A - s1 2 S dN2 1 2 SN2 M3 1 A A - s1 2 S dN3 1 2 SN3 and conclude that M 1 A A - s1 2 S d 3 N1N2N3 s1 2 SN1ds1 2 SN2 ds1 2 SN3 d 3. Verify that lnssM 1 AdyAd is minimized at the same location as M; use Lagrange multipli- ers and the results of Problem 2 to ind expressions for the values of Ni where the minimum occurs subject to the constraint v f - csln N1 1 ln N2 1 ln N3 d.

Find an expression for the minimum value of M as a function of vf . 5. If we want to put a three-stage rocket into orbit 100 miles above the earth’s surface, a inal velocity of approximately 17,500 miyh is required. Suppose that each stage is built with a structural factor S - 0.2 and an exhaust speed of c - 6000 miyh. (a) Find the minimum total mass M of the rocket engines as a function of A. (b) Find the mass of each individual stage as a function of A. (They are not equally sized!) 6. The same rocket would require a inal velocity of approximately 24,700 miyh in order to escape earth’s gravity. Find the mass of each individual stage that would minimize the total mass of the rocket engines and allow the rocket to propel a 500-pound probe into deep space. At a hydroelectric generating station (once operated by the Katahdin Paper Company) in Millinocket, Maine, water is piped from a dam to the power station. The rate at which the water lows through the pipe varies, depending on external conditions. The power station has three different hydroelectric turbines, each with a known (and unique) power function that gives the amount of electric power generated as a function of the water low arriving at the turbine. The incoming water can be apportioned in different volumes to each turbine, so the goal is to determine how to distribute water among the turbines to give the maximum total energy production for any rate of low. Using experimental evidence and Bernoulli’s equation, the following quadratic models were determined for the power output of each turbine, along with the allowable lows of operation: KW 1 - s218.89 1 0.1277Q 1 2 4.08 ? 10 25 Q 2 1 ds170 2 1.6 ? 10 26 Q 2 T d KW2 - s224.51 1 0.1358Q 2 2 4.69 ? 10 25 Q 2 2 ds170 2 1.6 ? 10 26 Q 2 T d KW3 - s227.02 1 0.1380Q 3 2 3.84 ? 10 25 Q 2 3 ds170 2 1.6 ? 10 26 Q 2 T d 250 < Q 1 < 1110, 250 < Q 2 < 1110, 250 < Q 3 < 1225 where Qi - flow through turbine i in cubic feet per second KWi - power generated by turbine i in kilowatts QT - total flow through the station in cubic feet per second 1. If all three turbines are being used, we wish to determine the low Qi to each turbine that will give the maximum total energy production. Our limitations are that the lows must sum to the total incoming low and the given domain restrictions must be observed. Consequently, use Lagrange multipliers to ind the values for the individual lows (as functions of QT) that maximize the total energy production KW1 1 KW2 1 KW3 subject to the constraints Q1 1 Q2 1 Q3 - QT and the domain restrictions on each Qi . 2. For which values of QT is your result valid? 3. For an incoming low of 2500 ft 3 ys, determine the distribution to the turbines and verify (by trying some nearby distributions) that your result is indeed a maximum. 4. Until now we have assumed that all three turbines are operating; is it possible in some situa- tions that more power could be produced by using only one turbine?

These ideas are then used to compute volumes, masses, and centroids of more general regions than we were able to consider in Chapters 6 and 8. We also use double integrals to calculate probabilities when two random variables are involved. We will see that polar coordinates are useful in computing double integrals over some types of regions. In a similar way, we will introduce two new coordinate systems in three-dimensional space––cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates––that greatly simplify the computation of triple integrals over certain commonly occurring solid regions. 15 Multiple Integrals © Juan Gaertner / Shutterstock.com Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","988 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals In much the same way that our attempt to solve the area problem led to the deinition of a deinite integral, we now seek to ind the volume of a solid and in the process we arrive at the deinition of a double integral. Review of the Definite Integral First let’s recall the basic facts concerning deinite integrals of functions of a single vari- able. If f s xd is deined for a < x < b, we start by dividing the interval fa, bg into n sub- intervals fx i21 , x i g of equal width Dx - sb 2 adyn and we choose sample points x i * in these subintervals. Then we form the Riemann sum 1 o n i-1 f s x i * d Dx and take the limit of such sums as n l ` to obtain the deinite integral of f from a to b: 2 y b a f s xd dx - lim n l ` o n i-1 f sx i * d Dx In the special case where f s xd > 0, the Riemann sum can be interpreted as the sum of the areas of the approximating rectangles in Figure 1, and y b a f s xd dx represents the area under the curve y - f s xd from a to b. x i x i-1 0 y x a b ¤ / ‹ x n-1 x¡ * x™ * x£ * x n * x i * Îx f(x i *) Volumes and Double Integrals In a similar manner we consider a function f of two variables deined on a closed rectangle R - fa, bg 3 fc, d g - hs x, yd [ R 2 | a < x < b, c < y < d j and we irst suppose that f s x, yd > 0. The graph of f is a surface with equation z - f s x, yd. Let S be the solid that lies above R and under the graph of f , that is, S - hs x, y, zd [ R 3 | 0 < z < f s x, yd, s x, yd [ R j (See Figure 2.) Our goal is to ind the volume of S. The irst step is to divide the rectangle R into subrectangles. We accomplish this by dividing the interval fa, bg into m subintervals fx i21 , x i g of equal width Dx - sb 2 adym and dividing fc, d g into n subintervals f y j21 , y j g of equal width Dy - sd 2 cdyn.

The volume of this box is the height of the box times the area of the base rectangle: f sx ij * , y ij * d DA If we follow this procedure for all the rectangles and add the volumes of the correspond- ing boxes, we get an approximation to the total volume of S: 3 V < o m i-1 o n j-1 f sx ij * , y ij * d DA (See Figure 5.)

","990 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals Our intuition tells us that the approximation given in (3) becomes better as m and n become larger and so we would expect that 4 V - lim m, n l ` o m i-1 o n j-1 f sx ij * , y ij * d DA We use the expression in Equation 4 to deine the volume of the solid S that lies under the graph of f and above the rectangle R. (It can be shown that this deinition is consis- tent with our formula for volume in Section 6.2.) Limits of the type that appear in Equation 4 occur frequently, not just in inding vol- umes but in a variety of other situations as well—as we will see in Section 15.4—even when f is not a positive function. So we make the following deinition. 5 Deinition The double integral of f over the rectangle R is y R y f s x, yd dA - lim m, n l ` o m i-1 o n j-1 f s x ij * , y ij * d DA if this limit exists. Notice the similarity between Definition 5 and the definition of a single integral in Equation 2. The precise meaning of the limit in Definition 5 is that for every number «. 0 there is an integer N such that Z y R y f s x, yd dA 2 o m i-1 o n j-1 f s x ij * , y ij * d DA Z ,« for all integers m and n greater than N and for any choice of sample points s x ij * , y ij * d in R ij . A function f is called integrable if the limit in Definition 5 exists. It is shown in courses on advanced calculus that all continuous functions are integrable. In fact, the double integral of f exists provided that f is “not too discontinuous.” In particular, if f is bounded on R, [that is, there is a constant M such that | f s x, yd | < M for all s x, yd in R], and f is continuous there, except on a finite number of smooth curves, then f is integrable over R. The sample point s x ij * , y ij * d can be chosen to be any point in the subrectangle R ij , but if we choose it to be the upper right-hand corner of R ij [namely s x i , y j d, see Figure 3], then the expression for the double integral looks simpler: 6 y R y f s x, yd dA - lim m, n l ` o m i-1 o n j-1 f s x i , y j d DA By comparing Definitions 4 and 5, we see that a volume can be written as a double integral: If f s x, yd > 0, then the volume V of the solid that lies above the rectangle R and below the surface z - f s x, yd is V - y R y f s x, yd dA The meaning of the double limit in Equation 4 is that we can make the double sum as close as we like to the number V [for any choice of s xij *, yij *d in Rij ] by taking m and n sufficiently large. Although we have defined the double integral by dividing R into equal-sized subrectangles, we could have used subrectangles Rij of unequal size. But then we would have to ensure that all of their dimensions approach 0 in the limiting process. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 15.1 Double Integrals over Rectangles 991 The sum in Deinition 5, o m i-1 o n j-1 f s x ij * , y ij * d DA is called a double Riemann sum and is used as an approximation to the value of the double integral. [Notice how similar it is to the Riemann sum in (1) for a function of a single variable.] If f happens to be a positive function, then the double Riemann sum represents the sum of volumes of columns, as in Figure 5, and is an approximation to the volume under the graph of f . EXAMPLE 1 Estimate the volume of the solid that lies above the square R - f0, 2g 3 f0, 2g and below the elliptic paraboloid z - 16 2 x 2 2 2y 2 . Divide R into four equal squares and choose the sample point to be the upper right corner of each square R i j . Sketch the solid and the approximating rectangular boxes. SOLUTION The squares are shown in Figure 6. The paraboloid is the graph of f s x, yd - 16 2 x 2 2 2y 2 and the area of each square is D A - 1. Approximating the volume by the Riemann sum with m - n - 2, we have V < o 2 i-1 o 2 j-1 f s x i , y j d DA - f s1, 1d DA 1 f s1, 2d DA 1 f s2, 1d DA 1 f s2, 2d DA - 13s1d 1 7s1d 1 10s1d 1 4s1d - 34 This is the volume of the approximating rectangular boxes shown in Figure 7. ■ We get better approximations to the volume in Example 1 if we increase the num- ber of squares. Figure 8 shows how the columns start to look more like the actual solid and the corresponding approximations become more accurate when we use 16, 64, and 256 squares.

","992 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals SOLUTION It would be very dificult to evaluate this integral directly from Deini- tion 5 but, because s1 2 x 2 > 0, we can compute the integral by interpreting it as a volume. If z - s1 2 x 2 , then x 2 1 z 2 - 1 and z > 0, so the given double integral represents the volume of the solid S that lies below the circular cylinder x 2 1 z 2 - 1 and above the rectangle R. (See Figure 9.) The volume of S is the area of a semicircle with radius 1 times the length of the cylinder. Thus y R y s1 2 x 2 dA - 1 2  s1d 2 3 4 - 2 ■ The Midpoint Rule The methods that we used for approximating single integrals (the Midpoint Rule, the Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule) all have counterparts for double integrals. Here we consider only the Midpoint Rule for double integrals. This means that we use a double Riemann sum to approximate the double integral, where the sample point s x ij * , y ij * d in R ij is chosen to be the center s x i , y j d of R ij . In other words, x i is the midpoint of fx i21 , x i g and y j is the midpoint of f y j21 , y j g. Midpoint Rule for Double Integrals y R y f s x, yd dA < o m i-1 o n j-1 f s x i , y j d DA where x i is the midpoint of fx i21 , x i g and y j is the midpoint of f y j21 , y j g. EXAMPLE 3 Use the Midpoint Rule with m - n - 2 to estimate the value of the integral yy R s x 2 3y 2 d dA, where R - hs x, yd | 0 < x < 2, 1 < y < 2j. SOLUTION In using the Midpoint Rule with m - n - 2, we evaluate f s x, yd - x 2 3y 2 at the centers of the four subrectangles shown in Figure 10. So x 1 - 1 2 , x 2 - 3 2 , y 1 - 5 4 , and y 2 - 7 4 . The area of each subrectangle is DA - 1 2 . Thus y R y s x 2 3y 2 d dA < o 2 i-1 o 2 j-1 f s x i , y j d DA - f s x 1 , y 1 d DA 1 f s x 1 , y 2 d DA 1 f s x 2 , y 1 d DA 1 f s x 2 , y 2 d DA - f ( 1 2 , 5 4 ) DA 1 f ( 1 2 , 7 4 ) DA 1 f ( 3 2 , 5 4 ) DA 1 f ( 3 2 , 7 4 ) DA - (2 67 16 ) 1 2 1 (2 139 16 ) 1 2 1 (2 51 16 ) 1 2 1 (2 123 16 ) 1 2 - 2 95 8 - 211.875 Thus we have y R y s x 2 3y 2 d dA < 211.875 ■ NOTE In Example 5 we will see that the exact value of the double integral in Exam- ple 3 is 212. (Remember that the interpretation of a double integral as a volume is valid only when the integrand f is a positive function. The integrand in Example 3 is not a positive function, so its integral is not a volume. In Examples 5 and 6 we will discuss how to interpret integrals of functions that are not always positive in terms of volumes.)

","SECTION 15.1 Double Integrals over Rectangles 993 Iterated Integrals Recall that it is usually dificult to evaluate single integrals directly from the deinition of an integral, but the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a much easier method. The evaluation of double integrals from irst principles is even more dificult, but here we see how to express a double integral as an iterated integral, which can then be evaluated by calculating two single integrals. Suppose that f is a function of two variables that is integrable on the rectangle R - fa, bg 3 fc, d g. We use the notation y d c f s x, yd dy to mean that x is held fixed and f s x, yd is integrated with respect to y from y - c to y - d. This procedure is called par- tial integration with respect to y. (Notice its similarity to partial differentiation.) Now y d c f s x, yd dy is a number that depends on the value of x, so it defines a function of x: As xd - y d c f s x, yd dy If we now integrate the function A with respect to x from x - a to x - b, we get 7 y b a As xd dx - y b a Fy d c f s x, yd dy G dx The integral on the right side of Equation 7 is called an iterated integral. Usually the brackets are omitted. Thus 8 y b a y d c f s x, yd dy dx - y b a Fy d c f s x, yd dy G dx means that we first integrate with respect to y from c to d and then with respect to x from a to b. Similarly, the iterated integral 9 y d c y b a f s x, yd dx dy - y d c Fy b a f s x, yd dx G dy means that we first integrate with respect to x (holding y fixed) from x - a to x - b and then we integrate the resulting function of y with respect to y from y - c to y - d. Notice that in both Equations 8 and 9 we work from the inside out. EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate the iterated integrals. (a) y 3 0 y 2 1 x 2 y dy dx (b) y 2 1 y 3 0 x 2 y dx dy SOLUTION (a) Regarding x as a constant, we obtain y 2 1 x 2 y dy - F x 2 y 2 2 G y-1 y-2 - x 2 S 2 2 2 D 2 x 2 S 1 2 2 D - 3 2 x 2 Thus the function A in the preceding discussion is given by As xd - 3 2 x 2 in this example. We now integrate this function of x from 0 to 3: y 3 0 y 2 1 x 2 y dy dx - y 3 0 Fy 2 1 x 2 y dy G dx - y 3 0 3 2 x 2 dx - x 3 2 G 0 3 - 27 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In general, it turns out (see Theorem 10) that the two iterated integrals in Equations 8 and 9 are always equal; that is, the order of integration does not matter. (This is similar to Clairaut’s Theorem on the equality of the mixed partial derivatives.) The following theorem gives a practical method for evaluating a double integral by expressing it as an iterated integral (in either order). 10 Fubini’s Theorem If f is continuous on the rectangle R - hs x, yd | a < x < b, c < y < d j, then y R y f s x, yd dA - y b a y d c f s x, yd dy dx - y d c y b a f s x, yd dx dy More generally, this is true if we assume that f is bounded on R, f is discontin- uous only on a inite number of smooth curves, and the iterated integrals exist. Theorem 10 is named after the Italian mathematician Guido Fubini (1879–1943), who proved a very gen- eral version of this theorem in 1907. But the version for continuous functions was known to the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy almost a cen- tury earlier. The proof of Fubini’s Theorem is too dificult to include in this book, but we can at least give an intuitive indication of why it is true for the case where f s x, yd > 0. Recall that if f is positive, then we can interpret the double integral yy R f s x, yd dA as the volume V of the solid S that lies above R and under the surface z - f s x, yd. But we have another formula that we used for volume in Chapter 6, namely, V - y b a As xd dx where As xd is the area of a cross-section of S in the plane through x perpendicular to the x-axis. From Figure 11 you can see that As xd is the area under the curve C whose equa- tion is z - f s x, yd, where x is held constant and c < y < d. Therefore As xd - y d c f s x, yd dy and we have y R y f s x, yd dA - V - y b a As xd dx - y b a y d c f s x, yd dy dx A similar argument, using cross-sections perpendicular to the y-axis as in Figure 12, shows that y R y f s x, yd dA - y d c y b a f s x, yd dx dy a x 0 z x b y A(x) C FIGURE 11 TEC Visual 15.1 illustrates Fubini’s Theorem by showing an animation of Figures 11 and 12. 0 y c x z y d FIGURE 12 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Therefore, when we evaluate double inte- grals it is wise to choose the order of integration that gives simpler integrals. FIGURE 13 For a function f that takes on both positive and negative values, yy R f s x, yd dA is a difference of volumes: V1 2 V2, where V1 is the volume above R and below the graph of f , and V2 is the volume below R and above the graph.

The function f is not a positive function, so its integral doesn’t repre- sent a volume. From Figure 13 we see that f is always negative on R, so the value of the integral is the negative of the volume that lies above the graph of f and below R. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

To be speciic, suppose that f s x, yd - ts xd hs yd and R - fa, bg 3 fc, d g. Then Fubini’s Theorem gives y R y f s x, yd dA - y d c y b a ts xd hs yd dx dy - y d c Fy b a ts xd hs yd dx G dy In the inner integral, y is a constant, so hs yd is a constant and we can write y d c Fy b a ts xd hs yd dx G dy - y d c F hs yd Sy b a ts xd dx DG dy - y b a ts xd dx y d c hs yd dy since y b a ts xd dx is a constant. Therefore, in this case the double integral of f can be writ- ten as the product of two single integrals: 11 y R y ts xd hs yd dA - y b a ts xd dx y d c hs yd dy where R - fa, bg 3 fc, d g EXAMPLE 8 If R - f0, y2g 3 f0, y2g, then, by Equation 11, y R y sin x cos y dA - y y2 0 sin x dx y y2 0 cos y dy - f2cos xg 0 y2 fsin yg 0 y2 - 1 ? 1 - 1 ■ y x z 0 0 1 22 1 0 y x z 16 12 8 4 0 FIGURE 15 The function f s x, yd - sin x cos y in Example 8 is positive on R, so the integral represents the volume of the solid that lies above R and below the graph of f shown in Figure 16.

","SECTION 15.2 Double Integrals over General Regions 1001 For single integrals, the region over which we integrate is always an interval. But for double integrals, we want to be able to integrate a function f not just over rectangles but also over regions D of more general shape, such as the one illustrated in Figure 1. We sup- pose that D is a bounded region, which means that D can be enclosed in a rectangular region R as in Figure 2. Then we define a new function F with domain R by 1 Fs x, yd - H 0 f s x, yd if if s x, yd is in D s x, yd is in R but not in D 0 y x D y 0 x D R FIGURE 2 FIGURE 1 If F is integrable over R, then we define the double integral of f over D by 2 y D y f s x, yd dA - y R y Fs x, yd dA where F is given by Equation 1 Definition 2 makes sense because R is a rectangle and so yy R Fs x, yd dA has been previ- ously defined in Section 15.1. The procedure that we have used is reasonable because the values of Fs x, yd are 0 when s x, yd lies outside D and so they contribute nothing to the integral. This means that it doesn’t matter what rectangle R we use as long as it con- tains D. In the case where f s x, yd > 0, we can still interpret yy D f sx, yd dA as the volume of the solid that lies above D and under the surface z - f s x, yd (the graph of f ). You can see that this is reasonable by comparing the graphs of f and F in Figures 3 and 4 and remember- ing that yy R Fs x, yd dA is the volume under the graph of F. y 0 z x D graph of f FIGURE 4 y 0 z x D graph of F FIGURE 3 Figure 4 also shows that F is likely to have discontinuities at the boundary points of D. Nonetheless, if f is continuous on D and the boundary curve of D is “well behaved” (in a sense outside the scope of this book), then it can be shown that yy R Fs x, yd dA exists Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1002 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals and therefore yy D f s x, yd dA exists. In particular, this is the case for the following two types of regions. A plane region D is said to be of type I if it lies between the graphs of two continuous functions of x, that is, D - hs x, yd | a < x < b, t 1 s xd < y < t 2 s xdj where t 1 and t 2 are continuous on fa, bg. Some examples of type I regions are shown in Figure 5. 0 y x b a D y=g™(x) y=g¡(x) 0 y x b a D y=g™(x) y=g¡(x) 0 y x b a D y=g™(x) y=g¡(x) In order to evaluate yy D f s x, yd dA when D is a region of type I, we choose a rect- angle R - fa, bg 3 fc, d g that contains D, as in Figure 6, and we let F be the function given by Equation 1; that is, F agrees with f on D and F is 0 outside D. Then, by Fubini’s Theorem, y D y f s x, yd dA - y R y Fs x, yd dA - y b a y d c Fs x, yd dy dx Observe that Fs x, yd - 0 if y , t 1 s xd or y . t 2 s xd because s x, yd then lies outside D. Therefore y d c Fs x, yd dy - y t 2 s xd t 1 s xd Fs x, yd dy - y t 2 s xd t 1 s xd f s x, yd dy because Fs x, yd - f s x, yd when t 1 s xd < y < t 2 s xd. Thus we have the following formula that enables us to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral. 3 If f is continuous on a type I region D such that D - hs x, yd | a < x < b, t 1 s xd < y < t 2 s xdj then y D y f s x, yd dA - y b a y t 2 s xd t 1 s xd f s x, yd dy dx The integral on the right side of (3) is an iterated integral that is similar to the ones we considered in the preceding section, except that in the inner integral we regard x as being constant not only in f s x, yd but also in the limits of integration, t 1 s xd and t 2 s xd. We also consider plane regions of type II, which can be expressed as 4 D - hs x, yd | c < y < d, h 1 s yd < x < h 2 s ydj where h 1 and h 2 are continuous. Two such regions are illustrated in Figure 7.

EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate yy D s x 1 2yd dA, where D is the region bounded by the parabolas y - 2x 2 and y - 1 1 x 2 . SOLUTION The parabolas intersect when 2x 2 - 1 1 x 2 , that is, x 2 - 1, so x - 61. We note that the region D, sketched in Figure 8, is a type I region but not a type II region and we can write D - hs x, yd | 21 < x < 1, 2x 2 < y < 1 1 x 2 j Since the lower boundary is y - 2x 2 and the upper boundary is y - 1 1 x 2 , Equa- tion 3 gives y D y s x 1 2yd dA - y 1 21 y 11x 2 2 x 2 s x 1 2yd dy dx - y 1 21 fxy 1 y 2 g y-2 x 2 y-11x 2 dx - y 1 21 fx s1 1 x 2 d 1 s1 1 x 2 d 2 2 x s2x 2 d 2 s2x 2 d 2 g dx - y 1 21 s23x 4 2 x 3 1 2x 2 1 x 1 1d dx - 23 x 5 5 2 x 4 4 1 2 x 3 3 1 x 2 2 1 x G 21 1 - 32 15 ■ NOTE When we set up a double integral as in Example 1, it is essential to draw a diagram. Often it is helpful to draw a vertical arrow as in Figure 8. Then the limits of integration for the inner integral can be read from the diagram as follows: The arrow starts at the lower boundary y - t 1 s xd, which gives the lower limit in the integral, and the arrow ends at the upper boundary y - t 2 s xd, which gives the upper limit of integra- tion. For a type II region the arrow is drawn horizontally from the left boundary to the right boundary.

SOLUTION In a question such as this, it’s wise to draw two diagrams: one of the three- dimensional solid and another of the plane region D over which it lies. Figure 13 shows the tetrahedron T bounded by the coordinate planes x - 0, z - 0, the vertical plane x - 2y, and the plane x 1 2y 1 z - 2. Since the plane x 1 2y 1 z - 2 intersects the xy-plane (whose equation is z - 0) in the line x 1 2y - 2, we see that T lies above the triangular region D in the xy-plane bounded by the lines x - 2y, x 1 2y - 2, and x - 0. (See Figure 14.) The plane x 1 2y 1 z - 2 can be written as z - 2 2 x 2 2y, so the required volume lies under the graph of the function z - 2 2 x 2 2y and above D - hsx , yd | 0 < x < 1, xy2 < y < 1 2 xy2j Therefore V - y D y s2 2 x 2 2yd dA - y 1 0 y 12xy2 xy2 s2 2 x 2 2yd dy dx - y 1 0 f2y 2 xy 2 y 2 g y-xy2 y-12xy2 dx - y 1 0 F 2 2 x 2 x S 1 2 x 2 D 2 S 1 2 x 2 D 2 2 x 1 x 2 2 1 x 2 4 G dx - y 1 0 s x 2 2 2x 1 1d dx - x 3 3 2 x 2 1 x G 0 1 - 1 3 ■ FIGURE 14 FIGURE 13 y=x/2 ”1,  ’ 1 2 D y 0 1 x 1 (0, 1, 0) (0, 0, 2) y x 0 z x+2y+z=2 x=2y ”1, , 0’ 1 2 T (or y=1-x/ 2)  x+2y=2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1006 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate the iterated integral y 1 0 y 1 x sins y 2 d dy dx. SOLUTION If we try to evaluate the integral as it stands, we are faced with the task of irst evaluating y sins y 2 d dy. But it’s impossible to do so in inite terms since y sins y 2 d dy is not an elementary function. (See the end of Section 7.5.) So we must change the order of integration. This is accomplished by irst expressing the given iter- ated integral as a double integral. Using (3) backward, we have y 1 0 y 1 x sins y 2 d dy dx - y D y sins y 2 d dA where D - hs x, yd | 0 < x < 1, x < y < 1j We sketch this region D in Figure 15. Then from Figure 16 we see that an alternative description of D is D - hs x, yd | 0 < y < 1, 0 < x < yj This enables us to use (5) to express the double integral as an iterated integral in the reverse order: y 1 0 y 1 x sins y 2 d dy dx - y D y sins y 2 d dA - y 1 0 y y 0 sins y 2 d dx dy - y 1 0 f x sins y 2 dg x-0 x-y dy - y 1 0 y sins y 2 d dy - 2 1 2 coss y 2 dg 0 1 - 1 2 s1 2 cos 1d ■ Properties of Double Integrals We assume that all of the following integrals exist. For rectangular regions D the irst three properties can be proved in the same manner as in Section 5.2. And then for general regions the properties follow from Deinition 2. 6 y D y f f s x, yd 1 ts x, ydg dA - y D y f s x, yd dA 1 y D y ts x, yd dA 7 y D y cf s x, yd dA - c y D y f s x, yd dA where c is a constant If f s x, yd > ts x, yd for all s x, yd in D, then 8 y D y f s x, yd dA > y D y ts x, yd dA The next property of double integrals is similar to the property of single integrals given by the equation y b a f s xd dx - y c a f s xd dx 1 y b c f s xd dx.

The next property of integrals says that if we integrate the constant function f s x, yd - 1 over a region D, we get the area of D: 10 y D y 1 dA - AsDd Figure 19 illustrates why Equation 10 is true: A solid cylinder whose base is D and whose height is 1 has volume AsDd  1 - AsDd, but we know that we can also write its volume as yy D 1 dA. Finally, we can combine Properties 7, 8, and 10 to prove the following property. (See Exercise 63.) 11 If m < f s x, yd < M for all s x, yd in D, then mAsDd < y D y f s x, yd dA < MAsDd EXAMPLE 6 Use Property 11 to estimate the integral yy D e sin x cos y dA, where D is the disk with center the origin and radius 2.

Be careful not to forget the addi- tional factor r on the right side of Formula 2. A classical method for remembering this is shown in Figure 5, where the “ininitesimal” polar rectangle can be thought of as an ordinary rectangle with dimensions r d and dr and therefore has “area” dA - r dr d.

It’s similar to the type II rectangular regions considered in Sec- tion 15.2. In fact, by combining Formula 2 in this section with Formula 15.2.5, we obtain the following formula. 3 If f is continuous on a polar region of the form D - hsr, d |  <  < , h 1 sd < r < h 2 sdj then y D y f s x, yd dA - y   y h2sd h 1 s d f sr cos , r sin d r dr d In particular, taking f s x, yd - 1, h 1 sd - 0, and h 2 sd - hsd in this formula, we see that the area of the region D bounded by  - ,  - , and r - hsd is AsDd - y D y 1 dA - y   y hsd 0 r dr d - y   F r 2 2 G 0 hs d d - y   1 2 fhsdg 2 d and this agrees with Formula 10.4.3.

Another geometric application is inding areas of surfaces and this will be done in the next sec- tion. In this section we explore physical applications such as computing mass, electric charge, center of mass, and moment of inertia. We will see that these physical ideas are also important when applied to probability density functions of two random variables. Density and Mass In Section 8.3 we were able to use single integrals to compute moments and the center of mass of a thin plate or lamina with constant density. But now, equipped with the double integral, we can consider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina occupies a region D of the xy-plane and its density (in units of mass per unit area) at a point s x, yd in D is given by s x, yd, where  is a continuous function on D. This means that s x, yd - lim Dm DA where Dm and DA are the mass and area of a small rectangle that contains s x, yd and the limit is taken as the dimensions of the rectangle approach 0. (See Figure 1.) To find the total mass m of the lamina we divide a rectangle R containing D into sub- rectangles R ij of the same size (as in Figure 2) and consider  s x, yd to be 0 outside D. If we choose a point s x ij * , y ij * d in R ij , then the mass of the part of the lamina that occupies R ij is approximately s x ij * , y ij * d DA, where DA is the area of R ij . If we add all such masses, we get an approximation to the total mass: m < o k i-1 o l j-1 s x ij * , y ij * d DA If we now increase the number of subrectangles, we obtain the total mass m of the lamina as the limiting value of the approximations: 1 m - lim k, l l ` o k i-1 o l j-1 s x ij * , y ij * d DA - y D y s x, yd dA Physicists also consider other types of density that can be treated in the same manner. For example, if an electric charge is distributed over a region D and the charge density 0 x y D ( x, y) FIGURE 1 R ij y 0 x (x ij , y ij ) * * FIGURE 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Suppose the lamina occupies a region D and has density function s x, yd. Recall from Chapter 8 that we deined the moment of a particle about an axis as the product of its mass and its directed distance from the axis. We divide D into small rectangles as in Figure 2. Then the mass of R ij is approximately s x ij * , y ij * d DA, so we can approximate the moment of R ij with respect to the x-axis by f s x ij * , y ij * d DAg y ij * If we now add these quantities and take the limit as the number of subrectangles becomes large, we obtain the moment of the entire lamina about the x-axis : 3 M x - lim m, n l` o m i-1 o n j-1 y ij * s x ij * , y ij * d DA - y D y y s x, yd dA Similarly, the moment about the y-axis is 4 M y - lim m, n l` o m i-1 o n j-1 x ij * s x ij * , y ij * d DA - y D y x s x, yd dA As before, we deine the center of mass s x , y d so that mx - M y and my - M x . The physi- cal signiicance is that the lamina behaves as if its entire mass is concentrated at its center of mass. Thus the lamina balances horizontally when supported at its center of mass (see Figure 4). 1 y 0 x (1, 1) y=1 y=1-x D FIGURE 3 D (x, y) FIGURE 4 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 15.4 Applications of Double Integrals 1019 SOLUTION Let’s place the lamina as the upper half of the circle x 2 1 y 2 - a 2 . (See Figure 6.) Then the distance from a point s x, yd to the center of the circle (the origin) is sx 2 1 y 2 . Therefore the density function is s x, yd - K sx 2 1 y 2 where K is some constant. Both the density function and the shape of the lamina suggest that we convert to polar coordinates. Then sx 2 1 y 2 - r and the region D is given by 0 < r < a, 0 <  < . Thus the mass of the lamina is m - y D y s x, yd dA - y D y K sx 2 1 y 2 dA - y  0 y a 0 sKrd r dr d - K y  0 d y a 0 r 2 dr - K r 3 3 G 0 a - Ka 3 3 Both the lamina and the density function are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, so the center of mass must lie on the y-axis, that is, x - 0. The y-coordinate is given by y - 1 m y D y y s x, yd dA - 3 Ka 3 y  0 y a 0 r sin  sKrd r dr d - 3 a 3 y  0 sin  d y a 0 r 3 dr - 3 a 3 f2cos g 0  F r 4 4 G 0 a - 3 a 3 2a 4 4 - 3a 2 Therefore the center of mass is located at the point s0, 3ays2dd. ■ Moment of Inertia The moment of inertia (also called the second moment) of a particle of mass m about an axis is deined to be mr 2 , where r is the distance from the particle to the axis. We extend this concept to a lamina with density function s x, yd and occupying a region D by proceeding as we did for ordinary moments. We divide D into small rectangles, approximate the moment of inertia of each subrectangle about the x-axis, and take the limit of the sum as the number of subrectangles becomes large. The result is the moment of inertia of the lamina about the x-axis: 6 I x - lim m, n l` o m i-1 o n j-1 s y ij * d 2 s x ij * , y ij * d DA - y D y y 2 s x, yd dA Similarly, the moment of inertia about the y-axis is 7 I y - lim m, n l` o m i-1 o n j-1 s x ij * d 2 s x ij * , y ij * d DA - y D y x 2 s x, yd dA 0 y x a _a a D ≈+¥=a@ ”0,         ’ 3a 2π FIGURE 6 Compare the location of the center of mass in Example 3 with Example 8.3.4, where we found that the center of mass of a lamina with the same shape but uniform density is located at the point s0, 4ays3dd.

","1020 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals It is also of interest to consider the moment of inertia about the origin, also called the polar moment of inertia: 8 I 0 - lim m, n l` o m i-1 o n j-1 fs x ij * d 2 1 s y ij * d 2 g s x ij * , y ij * d DA - y D y s x 2 1 y 2 d s x, yd dA Note that I 0 - I x 1 I y . EXAMPLE 4 Find the moments of inertia I x , I y , and I 0 of a homogeneous disk D with density s x, yd - , center the origin, and radius a. SOLUTION The boundary of D is the circle x 2 1 y 2 - a 2 and in polar coordinates D is described by 0 <  < 2, 0 < r < a. Let’s compute I 0 irst: I 0 - y D y s x 2 1 y 2 d dA -  y 2 0 y a 0 r 2 r dr d -  y 2 0 d y a 0 r 3 dr - 2 F r 4 4 G 0 a -  a 4 2 Instead of computing I x and I y directly, we use the facts that I x 1 I y - I 0 and I x - I y (from the symmetry of the problem). Thus I x - I y - I 0 2 -  a 4 4 ■ In Example 4 notice that the mass of the disk is m - density 3 area - s a 2 d so the moment of inertia of the disk about the origin (like a wheel about its axle) can be written as I 0 - a 4 2 - 1 2 s a 2 da 2 - 1 2 ma 2 Thus if we increase the mass or the radius of the disk, we thereby increase the moment of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational motion that mass plays in linear motion. The moment of inertia of a wheel is what makes it difi- cult to start or stop the rotation of the wheel, just as the mass of a car is what makes it difficult to start or stop the motion of the car. The radius of gyration of a lamina about an axis is the number R such that 9 mR 2 - I where m is the mass of the lamina and I is the moment of inertia about the given axis. Equation 9 says that if the mass of the lamina were concentrated at a distance R from the axis, then the moment of inertia of this “point mass” would be the same as the moment of inertia of the lamina. In particular, the radius of gyration y with respect to the x-axis and the radius of gyra- tion x with respect to the y-axis are given by the equations 10 my 2 - I x mx 2 - I y Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 15.4 Applications of Double Integrals 1021 Thus s x , y d is the point at which the mass of the lamina can be concentrated without changing the moments of inertia with respect to the coordinate axes. (Note the analogy with the center of mass.) EXAMPLE 5 Find the radius of gyration about the x-axis of the disk in Example 4. SOLUTION As noted, the mass of the disk is m - a 2 , so from Equations 10 we have y 2 - I x m - 1 4  a 4 a 2 - a 2 4 Therefore the radius of gyration about the x-axis is y - 1 2 a, which is half the radius of the disk. ■ Probability In Section 8.5 we considered the probability density function f of a continuous random variable X. This means that f s xd > 0 for all x, y ` 2` f s xd dx - 1, and the probability that X lies between a and b is found by integrating f from a to b: Psa < X < bd - y b a f s xd dx Now we consider a pair of continuous random variables X and Y, such as the lifetimes of two components of a machine or the height and weight of an adult female chosen at random. The joint density function of X and Y is a function f of two variables such that the probability that sX, Y d lies in a region D is PssX, Y d [ Dd - y D y f s x, yd dA In particular, if the region is a rectangle, the probability that X lies between a and b and Y lies between c and d is Psa < X < b, c < Y < d d - y b a y d c f s x, yd dy dx (See Figure 7.) c D z=f(x, y) d y x z a b FIGURE 7 The probability that X lies between a and b and Y lies between c and d is the volume that lies above the rectangle D=[a, b]x[c, d ] and below the graph of the joint density function.

","1022 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals Because probabilities aren’t negative and are measured on a scale from 0 to 1, the joint density function has the following properties: f s x, yd > 0 y R 2 y f s x, yd dA - 1 As in Exercise 15.3.40, the double integral over R 2 is an improper integral deined as the limit of double integrals over expanding circles or squares, and we can write y R 2 y f s x, yd dA - y ` 2` y ` 2` f s x, yd dx dy - 1 EXAMPLE 6 If the joint density function for X and Y is given by f s x, yd - H 0 Csx 1 2yd otherwise if 0 < x < 10, 0 < y < 10 ind the value of the constant C. Then ind PsX < 7, Y > 2d. SOLUTION We ind the value of C by ensuring that the double integral of f is equal to 1.

In fact, we can think of probability as being like continuously distributed mass. We calculate probability the way we calculate mass—by integrating a density function. And because the total “probability mass” is 1, the expressions for x and y in (5) show that we can think of the expected val- ues of X and Y,  1 and  2 , as the coordinates of the “center of mass” of the probability distribution. 20 20 D 0 y x x+y=20 FIGURE 8 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1024 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals In the next example we deal with normal distributions. As in Section 8.5, a single random variable is normally distributed if its probability density function is of the form f s xd - 1  s2 e 2sx2d 2 ys2 2 d where  is the mean and  is the standard deviation. EXAMPLE 8 A factory produces (cylindrically shaped) roller bearings that are sold as having diameter 4.0 cm and length 6.0 cm. In fact, the diameters X are normally distrib- uted with mean 4.0 cm and standard deviation 0.01 cm while the lengths Y are normally distributed with mean 6.0 cm and standard deviation 0.01 cm. Assuming that X and Y are independent, write the joint density function and graph it. Find the probability that a bearing randomly chosen from the production line has either length or diameter that differs from the mean by more than 0.02 cm.

In Section 8.2 we found the area of a very special type of surface––a surface of revolution––by the methods of single-variable calculus. Here we compute the area of a surface with equation z - f s x, yd, the graph of a function of two variables. Let S be a surface with equation z - f s x, yd, where f has continuous partial deriva- tives. For simplicity in deriving the surface area formula, we assume that f s x, yd > 0 and the domain D of f is a rectangle. We divide D into small rectangles R ij with area DA - Dx Dy. If s x i , y j d is the corner of R ij closest to the origin, let P ij s x i , y j , f s x i , y j dd be the point on S directly above it (see Figure 1). The tangent plane to S at P ij is an approx- imation to S near P ij . So the area DT ij of the part of this tangent plane (a parallelogram) that lies directly above R ij is an approximation to the area DS ij of the part of S that lies directly above R ij . Thus the sum oo DT ij is an approximation to the total area of S, and this approximation appears to improve as the number of rectangles increases. Therefore we deine the surface area of S to be 1 AsSd - lim m, n l` o m i-1 o n j-1 DT ij To ind a formula that is more convenient than Equation 1 for computational purposes, we let a and b be the vectors that start at P ij and lie along the sides of the parallelogram with area DT ij . (See Figure 2.) Then DT ij - | a 3 b | . Recall from Section 14.3 that f x s x i , y j d and f y s x i , y j d are the slopes of the tangent lines through P ij in the directions of a and b.

CAS CAS CAS CAS CAS CAS Just as we defined single integrals for functions of one variable and double integrals for functions of two variables, so we can define triple integrals for functions of three variables. Let’s first deal with the simplest case where f is defined on a rectangular box: 1 B - h s x, y, zd | a < x < b, c < y < d, r < z < s j The first step is to divide B into sub-boxes. We do this by dividing the interval fa, bg into l subintervals fx i21 , x i g of equal width Dx, dividing fc, d g into m subintervals of width Dy, and dividing fr, sg into n subintervals of width Dz. The planes through the endpoints of these subintervals parallel to the coordinate planes divide the box B into lmn sub-boxes B ijk - fx i21 , x i g 3 f y j21 , y j g 3 fz k21 , z k g which are shown in Figure 1. Each sub-box has volume DV - Dx Dy Dz. Then we form the triple Riemann sum 2 o l i-1 o m j-1 o n k-1 f s x ijk * , y ijk * , z ijk * d DV where the sample point s x ijk * , y ijk * , z ijk * d is in B ijk . By analogy with the definition of a double integral (15.1.5), we define the triple integral as the limit of the triple Riemann sums in (2).

There are ive other possible orders in which we can integrate, all of which give the same value. For instance, if we integrate with respect to y, then z, and then x, we have y y B y f s x, y, zd dV - y b a y s r y d c f s x, y, zd dy dz dx EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate the triple integral yyy B xyz 2 dV, where B is the rectangular box given by B - h s x, y, zd | 0 < x < 1, 21 < y < 2, 0 < z < 3 j SOLUTION We could use any of the six possible orders of integration.

","SECTION 15.6 Triple Integrals 1031 Now we deine the triple integral over a general bounded region E in three- dimensional space (a solid) by much the same procedure that we used for double inte- grals (15.2.2). We enclose E in a box B of the type given by Equation 1. Then we deine F so that it agrees with f on E but is 0 for points in B that are outside E. By deinition, y y E y f s x, y, zd dV - y y B y Fs x, y, zd dV This integral exists if f is continuous and the boundary of E is “reasonably smooth.” The triple integral has essentially the same properties as the double integral (Properties 6–9 in Section 15.2). We restrict our attention to continuous functions f and to certain simple types of regions. A solid region E is said to be of type 1 if it lies between the graphs of two con- tinuous functions of x and y, that is, 5 E - h s x, y, zd | s x, yd [ D, u 1 s x, yd < z < u 2 s x, yd j where D is the projection of E onto the xy-plane as shown in Figure 2. Notice that the upper boundary of the solid E is the surface with equation z - u 2 s x, yd, while the lower boundary is the surface z - u 1 s x, yd. By the same sort of argument that led to (15.2.3), it can be shown that if E is a type 1 region given by Equation 5, then 6 y y E y f s x, y, zd dV - y D y Fy u2sx, yd u1sx, yd f s x, y, zd dz G dA The meaning of the inner integral on the right side of Equation 6 is that x and y are held ixed, and therefore u 1 s x, yd and u 2 s x, yd are regarded as constants, while f s x, y, zd is integrated with respect to z. In particular, if the projection D of E onto the xy-plane is a type I plane region (as in Figure 3), then E - h s x, y, zd | a < x < b, t 1 s xd < y < t 2 s xd, u 1 s x, yd < z < u 2 s x, yd j and Equation 6 becomes 7 y y E y f sx, y, zd dV - y b a y t2sxd t1sxd y u2sx, yd u1sx, yd f s x, y, zd dz dy dx If, on the other hand, D is a type II plane region (as in Figure 4), then E - h s x, y, zd | c < y < d, h 1 s yd < x < h 2 s yd, u 1 s x, yd < z < u 2 s x, yd j and Equation 6 becomes 8 y y E y f s x, y, zd dV - y d c y h2s yd h1s yd y u2sx, yd u1sx, yd f s x, y, zd dz dx dy FIGURE 2 A type 1 solid region z 0 x y D E z=u™(x, y) z=u¡(x, y) FIGURE 3 A type 1 solid region where the projection D is a type I plane region z=u™(x, y) 0 D E y=g™(x) y=g¡(x) z y x a b z=u¡(x, y) x 0 z y c d z=u™(x, y) x=h™(y) x=h¡(y) z=u¡(x, y) E D FIGURE 4 A type 1 solid region with a type II projection Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1032 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate yyy E z dV, where E is the solid tetrahedron bounded by the four planes x - 0, y - 0, z - 0, and x 1 y 1 z - 1. SOLUTION When we set up a triple integral it’s wise to draw two diagrams: one of the solid region E (see Figure 5) and one of its projection D onto the xy-plane (see Figure 6). The lower boundary of the tetrahedron is the plane z - 0 and the upper boundary is the plane x 1 y 1 z - 1 (or z - 1 2 x 2 y), so we use u 1 s x, yd - 0 and u 2 s x, yd - 1 2 x 2 y in Formula 7. Notice that the planes x 1 y 1 z - 1 and z - 0 intersect in the line x 1 y - 1 (or y - 1 2 x) in the xy-plane. So the projection of E is the triangular region shown in Figure 6, and we have 9 E - h s x, y, zd | 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 1 2 x,0 < z < 1 2 x 2 y j This description of E as a type 1 region enables us to evaluate the integral as follows: y y E y z dV - y 1 0 y 12x 0 y 12x2y 0 z dz dy dx - y 1 0 y 12x 0 F z 2 2 G z-0 z-12x2y dy dx - 1 2 y 1 0 y 12x 0 s1 2 x 2 yd 2 dy dx - 1 2 y 1 0 F 2 s1 2 x 2 yd 3 3 G y-0 y-12x dx - 1 6 y 1 0 s1 2 xd 3 dx - 1 6 F 2 s1 2 xd 4 4 G 0 1 - 1 24 ■ A solid region E is of type 2 if it is of the form E - h s x, y, zd | s y, zd [ D, u 1 s y, zd < x < u 2 s y, zd j where, this time, D is the projection of E onto the y z-plane (see Figure 7). The back sur- face is x - u 1 s y, zd, the front surface is x - u 2 s y, zd, and we have 10 y y E y f s x, y, zd dV - y D y Fy u2s y, zd u1s y, zd f s x, y, zd dx G dA Finally, a type 3 region is of the form E - h s x, y, zd | s x, zd [ D, u 1 s x, zd < y < u 2 s x, zd j where D is the projection of E onto the x z-plane, y - u 1 s x, zd is the left surface, and y - u 2 s x, zd is the right surface (see Figure 8). For this type of region we have 11 y y E y f s x, y, zd dV - y D y Fy u2sx, zd u1sx, zd f s x, y, zd dy G dA In each of Equations 10 and 11 there may be two possible expressions for the integral depending on whether D is a type I or type II plane region (and corresponding to Equa- tions 7 and 8).

","SECTION 15.6 Triple Integrals 1033 SOLUTION The solid E is shown in Figure 9. If we regard it as a type 1 region, then we need to consider its projection D 1 onto the xy-plane, which is the parabolic region in Figure 10. (The trace of y - x 2 1 z 2 in the plane z - 0 is the parabola y - x 2 .) 0 FIGURE 10 Projection onto xy-plane FIGURE 9 Region of integration 0 4 y=≈+z@ E x y y=4 y=≈ D¡ x z y From y - x 2 1 z 2 we obtain z - 6sy 2 x 2 , so the lower boundary surface of E is z - 2sy 2 x 2 and the upper surface is z - sy 2 x 2 . Therefore the description of E as a type 1 region is E - h s x, y, zd | 22 < x < 2, x 2 < y < 4, 2sy 2 x 2 < z < sy 2 x 2 j and so we obtain y y E y s x 2 1 z 2 dV - y 2 22 y 4 x 2 y sy2x 2 2sy2x 2 sx 2 1 z 2 dz dy dx Although this expression is correct, it is extremely dificult to evaluate. So let’s instead consider E as a type 3 region. As such, its projection D 3 onto the x z-plane is the disk x 2 1 z 2 < 4 shown in Figure 11. Then the left boundary of E is the paraboloid y - x 2 1 z 2 and the right boundary is the plane y - 4, so taking u 1 s x, zd - x 2 1 z 2 and u 2 s x, zd - 4 in Equation 11, we have yy E y sx 2 1 z 2 dV - y D3 y Fy 4 x 2 1z 2 sx 2 1 z 2 dyG dA - y D3 y s4 2 x 2 2 z 2 d sx 2 1 z 2 dA Although this integral could be written as y 2 22 y s42x 2 2s42x 2 s4 2 x 2 2 z 2 d sx 2 1 z 2 dz dx it’s easier to convert to polar coordinates in the x z-plane: x - r cos , z - r sin .

SOLUTION We can write y 1 0 y x 2 0 y y 0 f s x, y, zd dz dy dx - y E yy f s x, y, zd dV where E - hs x, y, zd | 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < x 2 , 0 < z < y j. This description of E enables us to write projections onto the three coordinate planes as follows: on the xy-plane: D 1 - hs x, yd | 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < x 2 j - 5 s x, yd | 0 < y < 1, sy < x < 1 6 on the yz-plane: D 2 - hs y, zd | 0 < y < 1, 0 < z < y j on the x z-plane: D 3 - hs x, zd | 0 < x < 1, 0 < z < x 2 j From the resulting sketches of the projections in Figure 12 we sketch the solid E in Fig- ure 13. We see that it is the solid enclosed by the planes z - 0, x - 1, y - z and the parabolic cylinder y - x 2 sor x - sy d. If we integrate first with respect to x, then z, and then y, we use an alternate descrip- tion of E: E - 5 s x, y, zd | 0 < y < 1, 0 < z < y, sy < x < 1 6 Thus y y E y f sx, y, zd dV - y 1 0 y y 0 y 1 sy f s x, y, zd dx dz dy ■ Applications of Triple Integrals Recall that if f s xd > 0, then the single integral y b a f s xd dx represents the area under the curve y - f s xd from a to b, and if f s x, yd > 0, then the double integral yy D f s x, yd dA rep- resents the volume under the surface z - f s x, yd and above D. The corresponding inter- pretation of a triple integral yyy E f s x, y, zd dV, where f s x, y, zd > 0, is not very useful because it would be the “hypervolume” of a four-dimensional object and, of course, that is very difficult to visualize. (Remember that E is just the domain of the function f ; the graph of f lies in four-dimensional space.) Nonetheless, the triple integral yyy E f s x, y, zd dV can be interpreted in different ways in different physical situations, depending on the physical interpretations of x, y, z, and f s x, y, zd. Let’s begin with the special case where f s x, y, zd - 1 for all points in E. Then the triple integral does represent the volume of E: 12 VsE d - y y E y dV For example, you can see this in the case of a type 1 region by putting f s x, y, zd - 1 in Formula 6: y y E y 1 dV - y D y Fy u2sx, yd u1sx, yd dz G dA - y D y fu 2 s x, yd 2 u 1 s x, ydg dA FIGURE 12 Projections of E 0 z 1 y z=y 1 0 y 1 x y=≈ 1 0 z 1 x z=≈ 1 D¡ D™ D£ FIGURE 13 The solid E 0 z 1 x y y=≈ x=1 z=y 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

If the point P has Cartesian coordinates s x, yd and polar coordinates sr, d, then, from the igure, x - r cos  y - r sin  r 2 - x 2 1 y 2 tan  - y x In three dimensions there is a coordinate system, called cylindrical coordinates, that is similar to polar coordinates and gives convenient descriptions of some commonly occurring surfaces and solids. As we will see, some triple integrals are much easier to evaluate in cylindrical coordinates. Cylindrical Coordinates In the cylindrical coordinate system, a point P in three-dimensional space is represented by the ordered triple sr, , zd, where r and  are polar coordinates of the projection of P onto the xy-plane and z is the directed distance from the xy-plane to P. (See Figure 2.) To convert from cylindrical to rectangular coordinates, we use the equations 1 x - r cos  y - r sin  z - z whereas to convert from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates, we use 2 r 2 - x 2 1 y 2 tan  - y x z - z O y x ¨ x y r P( r, ¨)=P(x, y) FIGURE 1 In this project we ind formulas for the volume enclosed by a hypersphere in n-dimensional space. 1.

(b) Find cylindrical coordinates of the point with rectangular coordinates s3, 23, 27d. SOLUTION (a) The point with cylindrical coordinates s2, 2y3, 1d is plotted in Figure 3. From Equations 1, its rectangular coordinates are x - 2 cos 2 3 - 2 S 2 1 2 D - 21 y - 2 sin 2 3 - 2 S s3 2 D - s3 z - 1 So the point is s21, s3 , 1d in rectangular coordinates.

As with polar coordinates, there are ininitely many choices. ■ Cylindrical coordinates are useful in problems that involve symmetry about an axis, and the z-axis is chosen to coincide with this axis of symmetry. For instance, the axis of the circular cylinder with Cartesian equation x 2 1 y 2 - c 2 is the z-axis. In cylindrical coordinates this cylinder has the very simple equation r - c. (See Figure 4.) This is the reason for the name “cylindrical” coordinates. EXAMPLE 2 Describe the surface whose equation in cylindrical coordinates is z - r. SOLUTION The equation says that the z-value, or height, of each point on the surface is the same as r, the distance from the point to the z-axis. Because  doesn’t appear, it can vary. So any horizontal trace in the plane z - k sk . 0d is a circle of radius k. These traces suggest that the surface is a cone. This prediction can be conirmed by converting the equation into rectangular coordinates. From the irst equation in (2) we have z 2 - r 2 - x 2 1 y 2 We recognize the equation z 2 - x 2 1 y 2 (by comparison with Table 1 in Section 12.6) as being a circular cone whose axis is the z-axis (see Figure 5). ■ ”2,       , 1’ 2π 3 0 2π 3 2 1 x y z FIGURE 3 FIGURE 4 r=c, a cylinder 0 z y x (0, c, 0) (c, 0, 0) FIGURE 5 z=r , a cone 0 z x y Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","1042 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals Evaluating Triple Integrals with Cylindrical Coordinates Suppose that E is a type 1 region whose projection D onto the xy-plane is conveniently described in polar coordinates (see Figure 6). In particular, suppose that f is continuous and E - 5s x, y, zd | s x, yd [ D, u 1 s x, yd < z < u 2 s x, yd6 where D is given in polar coordinates by D - 5sr, d |  <  < , h 1 sd < r < h 2 sd6 We know from Equation 15.6.6 that 3 y y E y f s x, y, zd dV - y D y Fy u2sx, yd u1sx, yd f s x, y, zd dz G dA But we also know how to evaluate double integrals in polar coordinates.

It says that we convert a triple integral from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates by writing x - r cos , y - r sin , leaving z as it is, using the appropriate limits of integration for z, r, and , and replacing dV by r dz dr d. (Figure 7 shows how to remember this.) It is worthwhile to use this formula when E is a solid region easily described in cylindrical coordinates, and especially when the function f s x, y, zd involves the expression x 2 1 y 2 . EXAMPLE 3 A solid E lies within the cylinder x 2 1 y 2 - 1, below the plane z - 4, and above the paraboloid z - 1 2 x 2 2 y 2 . (See Figure 8.) The density at any point is proportional to its distance from the axis of the cylinder. Find the mass of E.

","SECTION 15.8 Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates 1045 Another useful coordinate system in three dimensions is the spherical coordinate system. It simpliies the evaluation of triple integrals over regions bounded by spheres or cones. Spherical Coordinates The spherical coordinates s , , d of a point P in space are shown in Figure 1, where  - | OP | is the distance from the origin to P,  is the same angle as in cylindrical coor- dinates, and  is the angle between the positive z-axis and the line segment OP. Note that  > 0 0 <  <  The spherical coordinate system is especially useful in problems where there is symmetry about a point, and the origin is placed at this point. For example, the sphere with center the origin and radius c has the simple equation  - c (see Figure 2); this is the reason for the name “spherical” coordinates.

From triangles OPQ and OPP9 we have z -  cos  r -  sin  But x - r cos  and y - r sin , so to convert from spherical to rectangular coordinates, we use the equations 1 x -  sin  cos  y -  sin  sin  z -  cos  Also, the distance formula shows that 2  2 - x 2 1 y 2 1 z 2 We use this equation in converting from rectangular to spherical coordinates.

","SECTION 15.8 Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates 1047 Evaluating Triple Integrals with Spherical Coordinates In the spherical coordinate system the counterpart of a rectangular box is a spherical wedge E - h s , , d | a <  < b,  <  < , c <  < d j where a > 0 and  2  < 2, and d 2 c < . Although we deined triple integrals by dividing solids into small boxes, it can be shown that dividing a solid into small spherical wedges always gives the same result. So we divide E into smaller spherical wedges E ijk  by means of equally spaced spheres  -  i , half-planes  -  j , and half- cones  -  k . Figure 7 shows that E ijk is approximately a rectangular box with dimen- sions D,  i D (arc of a circle with radius  i , angle D), and  i sin  k D (arc of a circle with radius  i sin  k , angle D). So an approximation to the volume of E ijk is given by DV ijk < sDds  i Dds  i sin  k Dd -  i 2 sin  k D D D In fact, it can be shown, with the aid of the Mean Value Theorem (Exercise 49), that the volume of E ijk is given exactly by DV ijk -  ~ i 2 sin  ~ k D D D where s  ~ i ,  ~ j ,  ~ k d is some point in E ijk .

","1052 CHAPTER 15 Multiple Integrals Suppose that a solid ball (a marble), a hollow ball (a squash ball), a solid cylinder (a steel bar), and a hollow cylinder (a lead pipe) roll down a slope. Which of these objects reaches the bottom irst? (Make a guess before proceeding.) To answer this question, we consider a ball or cylinder with mass m, radius r, and moment of inertia I (about the axis of rotation). If the vertical drop is h, then the potential energy at the top is mth. Suppose the object reaches the bottom with velocity v and angular velocity , so v - r. The kinetic energy at the bottom consists of two parts: 1 2 mv 2 from translation (moving down the slope) and 1 2 I 2 from rotation. If we assume that energy loss from rolling friction is negligible, then conservation of energy gives mth - 1 2 mv 2 1 1 2 I 2 1. Show that v 2 - 2t h 1 1 I * where I * - I mr 2 2. If ystd is the vertical distance traveled at time t, then the same reasoning as used in Problem 1 shows that v 2 - 2ty ys1 1 I *d at any time t. Use this result to show that y satisies the differential equation dy dt - Î 2t 1 1 I * ssin d sy where  is the angle of inclination of the plane. 3. By solving the differential equation in Problem 2, show that the total travel time is T - Î 2hs1 1 I * d t sin 2  This shows that the object with the smallest value of I * wins the race. 4.

","SECTION 15.9 Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals 1053 A change of variables can also be useful in double integrals. We have already seen one example of this: conversion to polar coordinates. The new variables r and  are related to the old variables x and y by the equations x - r cos  y - r sin  and the change of variables formula (15.3.2) can be written as y R y f s x, yd dA - y S y f sr cos , r sin d r dr d where S is the region in the r -plane that corresponds to the region R in the xy-plane. More generally, we consider a change of variables that is given by a transformation T from the uv-plane to the xy-plane: Tsu, vd - s x, yd where x and y are related to u and v by the equations 3 x - tsu, vd y - hsu, vd or, as we sometimes write, x - x su, vd y - y su, vd We usually assume that T is a C 1 transformation, which means that t and h have contin- uous irst-order partial derivatives. A transformation T is really just a function whose domain and range are both sub- sets of R 2 . If Tsu 1 , v 1 d - s x 1 , y 1 d, then the point s x 1 , y 1 d is called the image of the point su 1 , v 1 d. If no two points have the same image, T is called one-to-one. Figure 1 shows the effect of a transformation T on a region S in the uv-plane. T transforms S into a region R in the xy-plane called the image of S, consisting of the images of all points in S. 0 √ 0 y u x (u¡, √¡) (x¡, y¡) S R T –!

From the given equations we have x - u 2 , y - 0, and so 0 < x < 1. Thus S 1 is mapped into the line segment from s0, 0d to s1, 0d in the xy-plane. The second side, S 2 , is u - 1 s0 < v < 1d and, putting u - 1 in the given equations, we get x - 1 2 v 2 y - 2v Eliminating v, we obtain 4 x - 1 2 y 2 4 0 < x < 1 which is part of a parabola. Similarly, S 3 is given by v - 1 s0 < u < 1d, whose image is the parabolic arc 5 x - y 2 4 2 1 21 < x < 0 Finally, S 4 is given by u - 0 s0 < v < 1d whose image is x - 2v 2 , y - 0, that is, 21 < x < 0. (Notice that as we move around the square in the counterclockwise direction, we also move around the parabolic region in the counterclockwise direction.) The image of S is the region R (shown in Figure 2) bounded by the x-axis and the parabolas given by Equations 4 and 5. ■ Now let’s see how a change of variables affects a double integral.

Although the French mathematician Cauchy irst used these special determinants involving partial derivatives, Jacobi developed them into a method for evaluating multiple integrals. With this notation we can use Equation 6 to give an approximation to the area DA of R: 8 DA < Z -s x, yd -su, vd Z Du Dv where the Jacobian is evaluated at su 0 , v 0 d. r (u ¸, √ ¸) Îu r u Î√ r √ FIGURE 4 FIGURE 5 r (u ¸, √ ¸) r (u¸+Îu, √¸) R a b r (u¸, √¸+Î√) Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Notice that this double sum is a Riemann sum for the integral y S y f s tsu, vd, hsu, vdd Z -s x, yd -su, vd Z du dv The foregoing argument suggests that the following theorem is true. (A full proof is given in books on advanced calculus.) 9 Change of Variables in a Double Integral Suppose that T is a C 1 trans- formation whose Jacobian is nonzero and that T maps a region S in the uv-plane onto a region R in the xy-plane. Suppose that f is continuous on R and that R and S are type I or type II plane regions. Suppose also that T is one-to-one, except perhaps on the boundary of S. Then y R y f s x, yd dA - y S y f s x su, vd, y su, vdd Z -s x, yd -su, vd Z du dv Theorem 9 says that we change from an integral in x and y to an integral in u and v by expressing x and y in terms of u and v and writing dA - Z -s x, yd -su, vd Z du dv Notice the similarity between Theorem 9 and the one-dimensional formula in Equa- tion 2.

","SECTION 15.9 Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals 1057 As a irst illustration of Theorem 9, we show that the formula for integration in polar coordinates is just a special case. Here the transformation T from the r -plane to the xy-plane is given by x - tsr, d - r cos  y - hsr, d - r sin  and the geometry of the transformation is shown in Figure 7. T maps an ordinary rect- angle in the r -plane to a polar rectangle in the xy-plane.

SOLUTION The region R is pictured in Figure 2 (on page 1054). In Example 1 we discovered that T sS d - R, where S is the square f0, 1g 3 f0, 1g. Indeed, the reason for making the change of variables to evaluate the integral is that S is a much simpler region than R. First we need to compute the Jacobian: -sx, yd -su, vd - Z -x -u -x -v -y -u -y -v Z - Z 2u 2v 22v 2u Z - 4u 2 1 4v 2 . 0 Therefore, by Theorem 9, y R y y dA - y S y 2uv Z -s x, yd -su, vd Z dA - y 1 0 y 1 0 s2uvd4su 2 1 v 2 d du dv - 8 y 1 0 y 1 0 su 3 v 1 uv 3 d du dv - 8 y 1 0 f 1 4 u 4 v 1 1 2 u 2 v 3 g u-1 u-0 dv - y 1 0 s2v 1 4v 3 d dv - fv 2 1 v 4 g 0 1 - 2 ■ NOTE Example 2 was not a very dificult problem to solve because we were given a suitable change of variables.
