","xi The art of teaching, Mark Van Doren said, is the art of assisting discovery. I have tried to write a book that assists students in discovering calculus—both for its practical power and its surprising beauty. In this edition, as in the first seven editions, I aim to convey to the student a sense of the utility of calculus and develop technical competence, but I also strive to give some appreciation for the intrinsic beauty of the subject. Newton undoubtedly experienced a sense of triumph when he made his great discoveries. I want students to share some of that excitement. The emphasis is on understanding concepts. I think that nearly everybody agrees that this should be the primary goal of calculus instruction. In fact, the impetus for the cur- rent calculus reform movement came from the Tulane Conference in 1986, which for- mulated as their first recommendation: Focus on conceptual understanding. I have tried to implement this goal through the Rule of Three: “Topics should be pre- sented geometrically, numerically, and algebraically.” Visualization, numerical and graphical experimentation, and other approaches have changed how we teach concep- tual reasoning in fundamental ways. More recently, the Rule of Three has been expanded to become the Rule of Four by emphasizing the verbal, or descriptive, point of view as well. In writing the eighth edition my premise has been that it is possible to achieve con- ceptual understanding and still retain the best traditions of traditional calculus. The book contains elements of reform, but within the context of a traditional curriculum. I have written several other calculus textbooks that might be preferable for some instruc- tors. Most of them also come in single variable and multivariable versions. ● Calculus, Eighth Edition, is similar to the present textbook except that the exponen- tial, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions are covered in the second semester. ● Essential Calculus, Second Edition, is a much briefer book (840 pages), though it contains almost all of the topics in Calculus, Eighth Edition. The relative brevity is achieved through briefer exposition of some topics and putting some features on the website. ● Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals, Second Edition, resembles Essential Calculus, but the exponential, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions are covered in Chapter 3. A great discovery solves a great problem but there is a grain of discovery in the solution of any problem. Your problem may be modest; but if it challenges your curiosity and brings into play your inventive faculties, and if you solve it by your own means, you may experience the tension and enjoy the triumph of discovery.

","xii Preface ● Calculus: Concepts and Contexts, Fourth Edition, emphasizes conceptual under- standing even more strongly than this book. The coverage of topics is not encyclo- pedic and the material on transcendental functions and on parametric equations is woven throughout the book instead of being treated in separate chapters. ● Calculus: Early Vectors introduces vectors and vector functions in the first semester and integrates them throughout the book. It is suitable for students taking engineer- ing and physics courses concurrently with calculus. ● Brief Applied Calculus is intended for students in business, the social sciences, and the life sciences. ● Biocalculus: Calculus for the Life Sciences is intended to show students in the life sciences how calculus relates to biology. ● Biocalculus: Calculus, Probability, and Statistics for the Life Sciences contains all the content of Biocalculus: Calculus for the Life Sciences as well as three addi- tional chapters covering probability and statistics. The changes have resulted from talking with my colleagues and students at the Univer- sity of Toronto and from reading journals, as well as suggestions from users and review- ers. Here are some of the many improvements that I’ve incorporated into this edition: ● The data in examples and exercises have been updated to be more timely. ● New examples have been added (see Examples 6.1.5, 11.2.5, and 14.3.3, for instance). And the solutions to some of the existing examples have been amplified. ● Three new projects have been added: The project Controlling Red Blood Cell Loss During Surgery (page 244) describes the ANH procedure, in which blood is extracted from the patient before an operation and is replaced by saline solution. This dilutes the patient’s blood so that fewer red blood cells are lost during bleed- ing and the extracted blood is returned to the patient after surgery. The project Planes and Birds: Minimizing Energy (page 344) asks how birds can minimize power and energy by flapping their wings versus gliding. In the project The Speedo LZR Racer (page 936) it is explained that this suit reduces drag in the water and, as a result, many swimming records were broken. Students are asked why a small decrease in drag can have a big effect on performance. ● I have streamlined Chapter 15 (Multiple Integrals) by combining the first two sec- tions so that iterated integrals are treated earlier. ● More than 20% of the exercises in each chapter are new. Here are some of my favorites: 2.7.61, 2.8.36–38, 3.1.79–80, 3.11.54, 4.1.69, 4.3.34, 4.3.66, 4.4.80, 4.7.39, 4.7.67, 5.1.19–20, 5.2.67–68, 5.4.70, 6.1.51, 8.1.39, 12.5.81, 12.6.29–30, 14.6.65–66. In addition, there are some good new Problems Plus. (See Problems 12–14 on page 272, Problem 13 on page 363, Problems 16–17 on page 426, and Problem 8 on page 986.) Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","Preface xiii Conceptual Exercises The most important way to foster conceptual understanding is through the problems that we assign. To that end I have devised various types of problems. Some exercise sets begin with requests to explain the meanings of the basic concepts of the section. (See, for instance, the irst few exercises in Sections 2.2, 2.5, 11.2, 14.2, and 14.3.) Similarly, all the review sections begin with a Concept Check and a True-False Quiz. Other exercises test conceptual understanding through graphs or tables (see Exercises 2.7.17, 2.8.35–38, 2.8.47–52, 9.1.11–13, 10.1.24–27, 11.10.2, 13.2.1–2, 13.3.33–39, 14.1.1–2, 14.1.32–38, 14.1.41–44, 14.3.3–10, 14.6.1–2, 14.7.3–4, 15.1.6–8, 16.1.11–18, 16.2.17–18, and 16.3.1–2). Another type of exercise uses verbal description to test conceptual understanding (see Exercises 2.5.10, 2.8.66, 4.3.69–70, and 7.8.67). I particularly value problems that combine and compare graphical, numerical, and algebraic approaches (see Exercises 2.6.45–46, 3.7.27, and 9.4.4). Graded Exercise Sets Each exercise set is carefully graded, progressing from basic conceptual exercises and skill-development problems to more challenging problems involving applications and proofs. Real-World Data My assistants and I spent a great deal of time looking in libraries, contacting companies and government agencies, and searching the Internet for interesting real-world data to introduce, motivate, and illustrate the concepts of calculus. As a result, many of the examples and exercises deal with functions deined by such numerical data or graphs. See, for instance, Figure 1 in Section 1.1 (seismograms from the Northridge earthquake), Exercise 2.8.35 (unemployment rates), Exercise 5.1.16 (velocity of the space shuttle Endeavour), and Figure 4 in Section 5.4 (San Francisco power consumption). Functions of two variables are illustrated by a table of values of the wind-chill index as a function of air temperature and wind speed (Example 14.1.2). Partial derivatives are introduced in Section 14.3 by examining a column in a table of values of the heat index (perceived air temperature) as a function of the actual temperature and the relative humidity. This example is pursued further in connection with linear approximations (Example 14.4.3). Directional derivatives are introduced in Section 14.6 by using a temperature contour map to estimate the rate of change of temperature at Reno in the direction of Las Vegas. Double integrals are used to estimate the average snowfall in Colorado on December 20–21, 2006 (Example 15.1.9). Vector ields are introduced in Section 16.1 by depictions of actual velocity vector ields showing San Francisco Bay wind patterns. Projects One way of involving students and making them active learners is to have them work (perhaps in groups) on extended projects that give a feeling of substantial accomplish- ment when completed. I have included four kinds of projects: Applied Projects involve applications that are designed to appeal to the imagination of students. The project after Section 9.3 asks whether a ball thrown upward takes longer to reach its maximum height or to fall back to its original height. (The answer might surprise you.) The project after Section 14.8 uses Lagrange multipliers to determine the masses of the three stages of a rocket so as to minimize the total mass while enabling the rocket to reach a desired Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Laboratory Projects involve technology; the one following Section 10.2 shows how to use Bézier curves to design shapes that represent letters for a laser printer. Writ- ing Projects ask students to compare present-day methods with those of the founders of calculus—Fermat’s method for inding tangents, for instance. Suggested references are supplied. Discovery Projects anticipate results to be discussed later or encourage dis- covery through pattern recognition (see the one following Section 7.6). Others explore aspects of geometry: tetrahedra (after Section 12.4), hyperspheres (after Section 15.6), and intersections of three cylinders (after Section 15.7). Additional projects can be found in the Instructor’s Guide (see, for instance, Group Exercise 5.1: Position from Samples). Problem Solving Students usually have dificulties with problems for which there is no single well-deined procedure for obtaining the answer. I think nobody has improved very much on George Polya’s four-stage problem-solving strategy and, accordingly, I have included a version of his problem-solving principles following Chapter 1. They are applied, both explicitly and implicitly, throughout the book. After the other chapters I have placed sections called Problems Plus, which feature examples of how to tackle challenging calculus problems. In selecting the varied problems for these sections I kept in mind the following advice from David Hilbert: “A mathematical problem should be dificult in order to entice us, yet not inaccessible lest it mock our efforts.” When I put these challenging problems on assignments and tests I grade them in a different way. Here I reward a student signii- cantly for ideas toward a solution and for recognizing which problem-solving principles are relevant. Technology The availability of technology makes it not less important but more important to clearly understand the concepts that underlie the images on the screen. But, when properly used, graphing calculators and computers are powerful tools for discovering and understand- ing those concepts. This textbook can be used either with or without technology and I use two special symbols to indicate clearly when a particular type of machine is required. The icon ; indicates an exercise that deinitely requires the use of such technology, but that is not to say that it can’t be used on the other exercises as well. The symbol CAS is reserved for problems in which the full resources of a computer algebra system (like Maple, Mathematica, or the TI-89) are required. But technology doesn’t make pencil and paper obsolete. Hand calculation and sketches are often preferable to technology for illustrating and reinforcing some concepts. Both instructors and students need to develop the ability to decide where the hand or the machine is appropriate. Tools for Enriching Calculus TEC is a companion to the text and is intended to enrich and complement its contents. (It is now accessible in the eBook via CourseMate and Enhanced WebAssign. Selected Visuals and Modules are available at www.stewartcalculus.com.) Developed by Harvey Keynes, Dan Clegg, Hubert Hohn, and myself, TEC uses a discovery and exploratory approach. In sections of the book where technology is particularly appropriate, marginal icons direct students to TEC Modules that provide a laboratory environment in which they can explore the topic in different ways and at different levels. Visuals are anima- tions of igures in text; Modules are more elaborate activities and include exercises. Instructors can choose to become involved at several different levels, ranging from sim- ply encouraging students to use the Visuals and Modules for independent exploration, to assigning speciic exercises from those included with each Module, or to creating additional exercises, labs, and projects that make use of the Visuals and Modules.

","Preface xv TEC also includes Homework Hints for representative exercises (usually odd-num- bered) in every section of the text, indicated by printing the exercise number in red. These hints are usually presented in the form of questions and try to imitate an effective teaching assistant by functioning as a silent tutor. They are constructed so as not to reveal any more of the actual solution than is minimally necessary to make further progress. Enhanced WebAssign Technology is having an impact on the way homework is assigned to students, particu- larly in large classes. The use of online homework is growing and its appeal depends on ease of use, grading precision, and reliability. With the Eighth Edition we have been working with the calculus community and WebAssign to develop an online homework system. Up to 70% of the exercises in each section are assignable as online homework, including free response, multiple choice, and multi-part formats. The system also includes Active Examples, in which students are guided in step-by- step tutorials through text examples, with links to the textbook and to video solutions.

This is an overview of the subject and includes a list of questions to motivate the study of calculus. From the beginning, multiple representations of functions are stressed: verbal, numeri- cal, visual, and algebraic. A discussion of mathematical models leads to a review of the standard functions, including exponential and logarithmic functions, from these four points of view. The material on limits is motivated by a prior discussion of the tangent and velocity problems. Limits are treated from descriptive, graphical, numerical, and algebraic points of view. Section 2.4, on the precise definition of a limit, is an optional section.

","xvi Preface 2.7 and 2.8 deal with derivatives (especially with functions defined graphically and numerically) before the differentiation rules are covered in Chapter 3. Here the exam- ples and exercises explore the meanings of derivatives in various contexts. Higher deriva- tives are introduced in Section 2.8. All the basic functions, including exponential, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions, are differentiated here. When derivatives are computed in applied situations, students are asked to explain their meanings. Exponential growth and decay are now covered in this chapter. The basic facts concerning extreme values and shapes of curves are deduced from the Mean Value Theorem. Graphing with technology emphasizes the interaction between calculus and calculators and the analysis of families of curves. Some substantial optimi- zation problems are provided, including an explanation of why you need to raise your head 42° to see the top of a rainbow. The area problem and the distance problem serve to motivate the definite integral, with sigma notation introduced as needed. (Full coverage of sigma notation is provided in Appendix E.) Emphasis is placed on explaining the meanings of integrals in various contexts and on estimating their values from graphs and tables. Here I present the applications of integration—area, volume, work, average value—that can reasonably be done without specialized techniques of integration. General methods are emphasized. The goal is for students to be able to divide a quantity into small pieces, estimate with Riemann sums, and recognize the limit as an integral. All the standard methods are covered but, of course, the real challenge is to be able to recognize which technique is best used in a given situation. Accordingly, in Section 7.5, I present a strategy for integration. The use of computer algebra systems is discussed in Section 7.6. Here are the applications of integration—arc length and surface area—for which it is useful to have available all the techniques of integration, as well as applications to biol- ogy, economics, and physics (hydrostatic force and centers of mass). I have also included a section on probability. There are more applications here than can realistically be covered in a given course. Instructors should select applications suitable for their students and for which they themselves have enthusiasm. Modeling is the theme that unifies this introductory treatment of differential equations. Direction fields and Euler’s method are studied before separable and linear equations are solved explicitly, so that qualitative, numerical, and analytic approaches are given equal consideration. These methods are applied to the exponential, logistic, and other models for population growth. The first four or five sections of this chapter serve as a good introduction to first-order differential equations. An optional final section uses predator- prey models to illustrate systems of differential equations. This chapter introduces parametric and polar curves and applies the methods of calculus to them. Parametric curves are well suited to laboratory projects; the two presented here involve families of curves and Bézier curves. A brief treatment of conic sections in polar coordinates prepares the way for Kepler’s Laws in Chapter 13. 3 Diferentiation Rules 4 Applications of Diferentiation 5 Integrals 6 Applications of Integration 7 Techniques of Integration 8 Further Applications of Integration 9 Diferential Equations 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","Preface xvii The convergence tests have intuitive justifications (see page 719) as well as formal proofs. Numerical estimates of sums of series are based on which test was used to prove convergence. The emphasis is on Taylor series and polynomials and their applications to physics. Error estimates include those from graphing devices. The material on three-dimensional analytic geometry and vectors is divided into two chapters. Chapter 12 deals with vectors, the dot and cross products, lines, planes, and surfaces. This chapter covers vector-valued functions, their derivatives and integrals, the length and curvature of space curves, and velocity and acceleration along space curves, culmi- nating in Kepler’s laws. Functions of two or more variables are studied from verbal, numerical, visual, and alge- braic points of view. In particular, I introduce partial derivatives by looking at a specific column in a table of values of the heat index (perceived air temperature) as a function of the actual temperature and the relative humidity. Contour maps and the Midpoint Rule are used to estimate the average snowfall and average temperature in given regions. Double and triple integrals are used to compute probabilities, surface areas, and (in projects) volumes of hyperspheres and volumes of intersections of three cylinders. Cylindrical and spherical coordinates are introduced in the context of evaluating triple integrals. Vector fields are introduced through pictures of velocity fields showing San Francisco Bay wind patterns. The similarities among the Fundamental Theorem for line integrals, Green’s Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem are emphasized. Since first-order differential equations are covered in Chapter 9, this final chapter deals with second-order linear differential equations, their application to vibrating springs and electric circuits, and series solutions. Calculus, Early Transcendentals, Eighth Edition, is supported by a complete set of ancillaries developed under my direction. Each piece has been designed to enhance student understanding and to facilitate creative instruction. The tables on pages xxi–xxii describe each of these ancillaries. The preparation of this and previous editions has involved much time spent reading the reasoned (but sometimes contradictory) advice from a large number of astute reviewers. I greatly appreciate the time they spent to understand my motivation for the approach taken. I have learned something from each of them.

","xxiii To the Student Reading a calculus textbook is different from reading a newspaper or a novel, or even a physics book. Don’t be dis- couraged if you have to read a passage more than once in order to understand it. You should have pencil and paper and calculator at hand to sketch a diagram or make a calculation. Some students start by trying their homework problems and read the text only if they get stuck on an exercise. I sug- gest that a far better plan is to read and understand a section of the text before attempting the exercises. In particular, you should look at the definitions to see the exact meanings of the terms. And before you read each example, I suggest that you cover up the solution and try solving the problem your- self. You’ll get a lot more from looking at the solution if you do so. Part of the aim of this course is to train you to think logi- cally. Learn to write the solutions of the exercises in a con- nected, step-by-step fashion with explanatory sentences— not just a string of disconnected equations or formulas. The answers to the odd-numbered exercises appear at the back of the book, in Appendix I. Some exercises ask for a verbal explanation or interpretation or description. In such cases there is no single correct way of expressing the answer, so don’t worry that you haven’t found the definitive answer. In addition, there are often several different forms in which to express a numerical or algebraic answer, so if your answer differs from mine, don’t immediately assume you’re wrong. For example, if the answer given in the back of the book is s2 2 1 and you obtain 1 y(1 1 s2 ), then you’re right and rationalizing the denominator will show that the answers are equivalent. The icon ; indicates an exercise that definitely requires the use of either a graphing calculator or a computer with graphing software. But that doesn’t mean that graphing devices can’t be used to check your work on the other exer- cises as well. The symbol CAS is reserved for problems in which the full resources of a computer algebra system (like Maple, Mathematica, or the TI-89) are required. You will also encounter the symbol | , which warns you against committing an error. I have placed this symbol in the margin in situations where I have observed that a large proportion of my students tend to make the same mistake. Tools for Enriching Calculus, which is a companion to this text, is referred to by means of the symbol TEC and can be accessed in the eBook via Enhanced WebAssign and CourseMate (selected Visuals and Modules are available at www.stewartcalculus.com). It directs you to modules in which you can explore aspects of calculus for which the computer is particularly useful. You will notice that some exercise numbers are printed in red: 5. This indicates that Homework Hints are available for the exercise. These hints can be found on stewartcalcu- lus.com as well as Enhanced WebAssign and CourseMate. The homework hints ask you questions that allow you to make progress toward a solution without actually giving you the answer. You need to pursue each hint in an active manner with pencil and paper to work out the details. If a particular hint doesn’t enable you to solve the problem, you can click to reveal the next hint. I recommend that you keep this book for reference pur- poses after you finish the course. Because you will likely forget some of the specific details of calculus, the book will serve as a useful reminder when you need to use calculus in subsequent courses. And, because this book contains more material than can be covered in any one course, it can also serve as a valuable resource for a working scientist or engineer. Calculus is an exciting subject, justly considered to be one of the greatest achievements of the human intellect. I hope you will discover that it is not only useful but also intrinsically beautiful.

","xxiv Advances in technology continue to bring a wider variety of tools for doing mathematics. Handheld calculators are becoming more pow- erful, as are software programs and Internet resources. In addition, many mathematical applications have been released for smartphones and tablets such as the iPad. Some exercises in this text are marked with a graphing icon ; , which indicates that the use of some technology is required. Often this means that we intend for a graphing device to be used in drawing the graph of a function or equation. You might also need technology to ind the zeros of a graph or the points of intersection of two graphs. In some cases we will use a calculating device to solve an equation or evaluate a deinite integral numerically. Many scientiic and graphing calculators have these features built in, such as the Texas Instruments TI-84 or TI-Nspire CX. Similar calculators are made by Hewlett Pack- ard, Casio, and Sharp. © Dan Clegg © Dan Clegg You can also use computer software such as Graphing Calculator by Paciic Tech (www.paciict.com) to perform many of these functions, as well as apps for phones and tablets, like Quick Graph (Colombiamug) or Math-Studio (Pomegranate Apps). Similar functionality is available using a web interface at WolframAlpha.com. © Dan Clegg Calculators, Computers, and Other Graphing Devices Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","xxv © Dan Clegg The CAS icon is reserved for problems in which the full resources of a computer algebra system (CAS) are required. A CAS is capable of doing mathematics (like solving equations, computing derivatives or integrals) symbolically rather than just numerically. Examples of well-established computer algebra systems are the com- puter software packages Maple and Mathematica. The WolframAlpha website uses the Mathematica engine to provide CAS functionality via the Web. Many handheld graphing calculators have CAS capabilities, such as the TI-89 and TI-Nspire CX CAS from Texas Instruments. Some tablet and smartphone apps also provide these capabilities, such as the previously mentioned MathStudio. In general, when we use the term “calculator” in this book, we mean the use of any of the resources we have mentioned. © Dan Clegg © Dan Clegg Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","xxvi Success in calculus depends to a large extent on knowledge of the mathematics that precedes calculus: algebra, analytic geometry, functions, and trigonometry. The fol- lowing tests are intended to diagnose weaknesses that you might have in these areas.

A Preview of Calculus CALCULUS IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM the mathematics that you have studied previ- ously: calculus is less static and more dynamic. It is concerned with change and motion; it deals with quantities that approach other quantities. For that reason it may be useful to have an overview of the subject before beginning its intensive study. Here we give a glimpse of some of the main ideas of calculus by showing how the concept of a limit arises when we attempt to solve a variety of problems. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","2 A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS The Area Problem The origins of calculus go back at least 2500 years to the ancient Greeks, who found areas using the “method of exhaustion.” They knew how to ind the area A of any poly- gon by dividing it into triangles as in Figure 1 and adding the areas of these triangles. It is a much more dificult problem to ind the area of a curved igure. The Greek method of exhaustion was to inscribe polygons in the igure and circumscribe polygons about the igure and then let the number of sides of the polygons increase. Figure 2 illus- trates this process for the special case of a circle with inscribed regular polygons. A¡™  A¶  Aß A∞ A¢ A£ Let A n be the area of the inscribed polygon with n sides. As n increases, it appears that A n becomes closer and closer to the area of the circle. We say that the area of the circle is the limit of the areas of the inscribed polygons, and we write A - lim n l ` A n The Greeks themselves did not use limits explicitly. However, by indirect reasoning, Eudoxus (ifth century bc) used exhaustion to prove the familiar formula for the area of a circle: A - r 2 . We will use a similar idea in Chapter 5 to ind areas of regions of the type shown in Figure 3. We will approximate the desired area A by areas of rectangles (as in Figure 4), let the width of the rectangles decrease, and then calculate A as the limit of these sums of areas of rectangles. 1 n 1 0 x y (1, 1) 1 0 x y (1, 1) 1 4 1 2 3 4 0 x y 1 (1, 1) 1 0 x y y=≈ A (1, 1) The area problem is the central problem in the branch of calculus called integral cal- culus. The techniques that we will develop in Chapter 5 for inding areas will also enable us to compute the volume of a solid, the length of a curve, the force of water against a dam, the mass and center of gravity of a rod, and the work done in pumping water out of a tank. The Tangent Problem Consider the problem of trying to ind an equation of the tangent line t to a curve with equation y - f s xd at a given point P . (We will give a precise deinition of a tangent line in A=A¡+A™+A£+A¢+A∞ A¡ A™ A£ A¢ A∞ FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 TEC In the Preview Visual, you can see how areas of inscribed and circumscribed polygons approximate the area of a circle.

For now you can think of it as a line that touches the curve at P as in Figure 5.) Since we know that the point P lies on the tangent line, we can ind the equation of t if we know its slope m. The problem is that we need two points to compute the slope and we know only one point, P, on t. To get around the problem we irst ind an approximation to m by taking a nearby point Q on the curve and computing the slope m PQ of the secant line PQ. From Figure 6 we see that 1 m PQ - f sxd 2 f sad x 2 a Now imagine that Q moves along the curve toward P as in Figure 7. You can see that the secant line rotates and approaches the tangent line as its limiting position. This means that the slope m PQ of the secant line becomes closer and closer to the slope m of the tan- gent line. We write m - lim Q lP m PQ and we say that m is the limit of m PQ as Q approaches P along the curve. Because x approaches a as Q approaches P, we could also use Equation 1 to write 2 m - lim x l a f sxd 2 f sad x 2 a Speciic examples of this procedure will be given in Chapter 2. The tangent problem has given rise to the branch of calculus called differential calcu- lus, which was not invented until more than 2000 years after integral calculus. The main ideas behind differential calculus are due to the French mathematician Pierre Fer- mat (1601–1665) and were developed by the English mathematicians John Wallis (1616–1703), Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), and Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and the Ger- man mathematician Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). The two branches of calculus and their chief problems, the area problem and the tan- gent problem, appear to be very different, but it turns out that there is a very close con- nection between them. The tangent problem and the area problem are inverse problems in a sense that will be described in Chapter 5. Velocity When we look at the speedometer of a car and read that the car is traveling at 48 miyh, what does that information indicate to us? We know that if the velocity remains constant, then after an hour we will have traveled 48 mi. But if the velocity of the car varies, what does it mean to say that the velocity at a given instant is 48 miyh? In order to analyze this question, let’s examine the motion of a car that travels along a straight road and assume that we can measure the distance traveled by the car (in feet) at l-second intervals as in the following chart: t - Time elapsed ssd 0 1 2 3 4 5 d - Distance sftd 0 2 9 24 42 71 0 y x P y=ƒ t P Q t 0 x y y 0 x a x ƒ-f(a) P{a, f(a)} x-a t Q{x, ƒ} FIGURE 5 The tangent line at P FIGURE 6 The secant line at PQ FIGURE 7 Secant lines approaching the tangent line A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","4 A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS As a irst step toward inding the velocity after 2 seconds have elapsed, we ind the aver- age velocity during the time interval 2 < t < 4: average velocity - change in position time elapsed - 42 2 9 4 2 2 - 16.5 fty s Similarly, the average velocity in the time interval 2 < t < 3 is average velocity - 24 2 9 3 2 2 - 15 fty s We have the feeling that the velocity at the instant t - 2 can’t be much different from the average velocity during a short time interval starting at t - 2. So let’s imagine that the dis- tance traveled has been measured at 0.l-second time intervals as in the following chart: t 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 d 9.00 10.02 11.16 12.45 13.96 15.80 Then we can compute, for instance, the average velocity over the time interval f2, 2.5g: average velocity - 15.80 2 9.00 2.5 2 2 - 13.6 fty s The results of such calculations are shown in the following chart: Time interval f2, 3g f2, 2.5g f2, 2.4g f2, 2.3g f2, 2.2g f2, 2.1g Average velocity sft ysd 15.0 13.6 12.4 11.5 10.8 10.2 The average velocities over successively smaller intervals appear to be getting closer to a number near 10, and so we expect that the velocity at exactly t - 2 is about 10 ftys. In Chapter 2 we will deine the instantaneous velocity of a moving object as the limiting value of the average velocities over smaller and smaller time intervals. In Figure 8 we show a graphical representation of the motion of the car by plotting the distance traveled as a function of time. If we write d - f std, then f std is the number of feet traveled after t seconds. The average velocity in the time interval f2, tg is average velocity - change in position time elapsed - f std 2 f s2d t 2 2 which is the same as the slope of the secant line PQ in Figure 8. The velocity v when t - 2 is the limiting value of this average velocity as t approaches 2; that is, v - lim t l 2 f std 2 f s2d t 2 2 and we recognize from Equation 2 that this is the same as the slope of the tangent line to the curve at P . t d 0 1 2 3 4 5 10 20 P{2, f(2)} Q{ t, f(t)} FIGURE 8 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS 5 Thus, when we solve the tangent problem in differential calculus, we are also solving problems concerning velocities. The same techniques also enable us to solve problems involving rates of change in all of the natural and social sciences. The Limit of a Sequence In the ifth century bc the Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea posed four problems, now known as Zeno’s paradoxes, that were intended to challenge some of the ideas concerning space and time that were held in his day. Zeno’s second paradox concerns a race between the Greek hero Achilles and a tortoise that has been given a head start. Zeno argued, as fol- lows, that Achilles could never pass the tortoise: Suppose that Achilles starts at position a 1 and the tortoise starts at position t 1 . (See Figure 9.) When Achilles reaches the point a 2 - t 1 , the tortoise is farther ahead at position t 2 . When Achilles reaches a 3 - t 2 , the tor- toise is at t 3 . This process continues indeinitely and so it appears that the tortoise will always be ahead! But this deies common sense. Achilles tortoise a¡ a™ a£ a¢ a∞ t¡ t™ t£ t¢ . . . . . . One way of explaining this paradox is with the idea of a sequence. The successive posi- tions of Achilles sa 1 , a 2 , a 3 , . . .d or the successive positions of the tortoise st 1 , t 2 , t 3 , . . .d form what is known as a sequence. In general, a sequence ha n j is a set of numbers written in a deinite order. For instance, the sequence h1, 1 2 , 1 3 , 1 4 , 1 5 , . . . j can be described by giving the following formula for the nth term: a n - 1 n We can visualize this sequence by plotting its terms on a number line as in Fig- ure 10(a) or by drawing its graph as in Figure 10(b). Observe from either picture that the terms of the sequence a n - 1 yn are becoming closer and closer to 0 as n increases. In fact, we can ind terms as small as we please by making n large enough. We say that the limit of the sequence is 0, and we indicate this by writing lim n l ` 1 n - 0 In general, the notation lim n l ` a n - L is used if the terms a n approach the number L as n becomes large. This means that the num- bers a n can be made as close as we like to the number L by taking n suficiently large.

","6 A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS The concept of the limit of a sequence occurs whenever we use the decimal represen- tation of a real number. For instance, if a 1 - 3.1 a 2 - 3.14 a 3 - 3.141 a 4 - 3.1415 a 5 - 3.14159 a 6 - 3.141592 a 7 - 3.1415926 f then lim n l` a n -  The terms in this sequence are rational approximations to . Let’s return to Zeno’s paradox. The successive positions of Achilles and the tortoise form sequences ha n j and h t n j, where a n , t n for all n. It can be shown that both sequences have the same limit: lim n l ` a n - p - lim n l ` t n It is precisely at this point p that Achilles overtakes the tortoise. The Sum of a Series Another of Zeno’s paradoxes, as passed on to us by Aristotle, is the following: “A man standing in a room cannot walk to the wall. In order to do so, he would irst have to go half the distance, then half the remaining distance, and then again half of what still remains. This process can always be continued and can never be ended.” (See Figure 11.) 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 Of course, we know that the man can actually reach the wall, so this suggests that per- haps the total distance can be expressed as the sum of ininitely many smaller distances as follows: 3 1 - 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 1 ∙∙∙ 1 1 2 n 1 ∙∙∙ FIGURE 11 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS 7 Zeno was arguing that it doesn’t make sense to add ininitely many numbers together. But there are other situations in which we implicitly use ininite sums. For instance, in decimal notation, the symbol 0.3 - 0.3333 . . . means 3 10 1 3 100 1 3 1000 1 3 10,000 1 ∙∙∙ and so, in some sense, it must be true that 3 10 1 3 100 1 3 1000 1 3 10,000 1 ∙∙∙ - 1 3 More generally, if d n denotes the nth digit in the decimal representation of a number, then 0.d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 ... - d 1 10 1 d 2 10 2 1 d 3 10 3 1 ∙∙∙ 1 d n 10 n 1 ∙∙∙ Therefore some ininite sums, or ininite series as they are called, have a meaning. But we must deine carefully what the sum of an ininite series is. Returning to the series in Equation 3, we denote by s n the sum of the irst n terms of the series. Thus s 1 - 1 2 - 0.5 s 2 - 1 2 1 1 4 - 0.75 s 3 - 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 - 0.875 s 4 - 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 - 0.9375 s 5 - 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 1 1 32 - 0.96875 s 6 - 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 1 1 32 1 1 64 - 0.984375 s 7 - 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 1 1 32 1 1 64 1 1 128 - 0.9921875 f s 10 - 1 2 1 1 4 1 ∙∙∙ 1 1 1024 < 0.99902344 f s 16 - 1 2 1 1 4 1 ∙∙∙ 1 1 2 16 < 0.99998474 Observe that as we add more and more terms, the partial sums become closer and closer to 1. In fact, it can be shown that by taking n large enough (that is, by adding suficiently many terms of the series), we can make the partial sum s n as close as we please to the num- ber 1. It therefore seems reasonable to say that the sum of the ininite series is 1 and to write 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 ∙∙∙ 1 1 2 n 1 ∙∙∙ - 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","8 A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS In other words, the reason the sum of the series is 1 is that lim n l ` s n - 1 In Chapter 11 we will discuss these ideas further. We will then use Newton’s idea of combining ininite series with differential and integral calculus. Summary We have seen that the concept of a limit arises in trying to ind the area of a region, the slope of a tangent to a curve, the velocity of a car, or the sum of an ininite series. In each case the common theme is the calculation of a quantity as the limit of other, easily calculated quantities. It is this basic idea of a limit that sets calculus apart from other areas of mathematics. In fact, we could deine calculus as the part of mathematics that deals with limits. After Sir Isaac Newton invented his version of calculus, he used it to explain the motion of the planets around the sun. Today calculus is used in calculating the orbits of satellites and spacecraft, in predicting population sizes, in estimating how fast oil prices rise or fall, in forecasting weather, in measuring the cardiac output of the heart, in cal- culating life insurance premiums, and in a great variety of other areas. We will explore some of these uses of calculus in this book. In order to convey a sense of the power of the subject, we end this preview with a list of some of the questions that you will be able to answer using calculus: 1. How can we explain the fact, illustrated in Figure 12, that the angle of elevation from an observer up to the highest point in a rainbow is 42°? (See page 285.) 2. How can we explain the shapes of cans on supermarket shelves? (See page 343.) 3. Where is the best place to sit in a movie theater? (See page 465.) 4. How can we design a roller coaster for a smooth ride? (See page 182.) 5. How far away from an airport should a pilot start descent? (See page 208.) 6. How can we it curves together to design shapes to represent letters on a laser printer? (See page 657.) 7. How can we estimate the number of workers that were needed to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu in ancient Egypt? (See page 460.) 8. Where should an inielder position himself to catch a baseball thrown by an outielder and relay it to home plate? (See page 465.) 9. Does a ball thrown upward take longer to reach its maximum height or to fall back to its original height? (See page 609.) 10. How can we explain the fact that planets and satellites move in elliptical orbits? (See page 868.) 11. How can we distribute water low among turbines at a hydroelectric station so as to maximize the total energy production? (See page 980.) 12.

","9 Often a graph is the best way to represent a function because it conveys so much information at a glance. Shown is a graph of the vertical ground acceleration created by the 2011 earthquake near Tohoku, Japan. The earthquake had a magnitude of 9.0 on the Richter scale and was so powerful that it moved northern Japan 8 feet closer to North America. Functions and Models THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTS THAT WE deal with in calculus are functions. This chapter pre- pares the way for calculus by discussing the basic ideas concerning functions, their graphs, and ways of transforming and combining them. We stress that a function can be represented in different ways: by an equation, in a table, by a graph, or in words. We look at the main types of functions that occur in calculus and describe the process of using these functions as mathematical models of real-world phenomena. 1 Pictura Collectus/Alamy Seismological Society of America 0 1000 _1000 2000 _2000 50 0 100 150 200 (cm/s@) time Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","10 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another. Consider the following four situations. A. The area A of a circle depends on the radius r of the circle. The rule that connects r and A is given by the equation A - r 2 . With each positive number r there is associ- ated one value of A, and we say that A is a function of r. B. The human population of the world P depends on the time t. The table gives esti- mates of the world population Pstd at time t, for certain years. For instance, Ps1950d< 2,560,000,000 But for each value of the time t there is a corresponding value of P, and we say that P is a function of t. C. The cost C of mailing an envelope depends on its weight w. Although there is no simple formula that connects w and C, the post ofice has a rule for determining C when w is known. D. The vertical acceleration a of the ground as measured by a seismograph during an earthquake is a function of the elapsed time t. Figure 1 shows a graph generated by seismic activity during the Northridge earthquake that shook Los Angeles in 1994. For a given value of t, the graph provides a corresponding value of a. {cm/s@} (seconds) 5 50 10 15 20 25 a t 100 30 _50 Calif. Dept. of Mines and Geology Each of these examples describes a rule whereby, given a number (r, t, w, or t), another number ( A, P, C, or a) is assigned. In each case we say that the second number is a function of the irst number. A function f is a rule that assigns to each element x in a set D exactly one element, called f s xd, in a set E. We usually consider functions for which the sets D and E are sets of real numbers. The set D is called the domain of the function. The number f s xd is the value of f at x and is read “ f of x.” The range of f is the set of all possible values of f s xd as x varies throughout the domain. A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the domain of a function f is called an independent variable. A symbol that represents a number in the range of f is called a dependent variable. In Example A, for instance, r is the indepen- dent variable and A is the dependent variable.

","SECTION 1.1 Four Ways to Represent a Function 11 It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine (see Figure 2). If x is in the domain of the function f, then when x enters the machine, it’s accepted as an input and the machine produces an output f s xd according to the rule of the function. Thus we can think of the domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all possible outputs. The preprogrammed functions in a calculator are good examples of a function as a machine. For example, the square root key on your calculator computes such a function. You press the key labeled s (or sx ) and enter the input x. If x , 0, then x is not in the domain of this function; that is, x is not an acceptable input, and the calculator will indi- cate an error. If x > 0, then an approximation to sx will appear in the display. Thus the sx key on your calculator is not quite the same as the exact mathematical function f deined by f s xd - sx . Another way to picture a function is by an arrow diagram as in Figure 3. Each arrow connects an element of D to an element of E. The arrow indicates that f s xd is associated with x, f sad is associated with a, and so on. The most common method for visualizing a function is its graph. If f is a function with domain D, then its graph is the set of ordered pairs hs x, f s xdd | x [ Dj (Notice that these are input-output pairs.) In other words, the graph of f consists of all points s x, yd in the coordinate plane such that y - f s xd and x is in the domain of f. The graph of a function f gives us a useful picture of the behavior or “life history” of a function. Since the y-coordinate of any point s x, yd on the graph is y - f s xd, we can read the value of f s xd from the graph as being the height of the graph above the point x (see Figure 4). The graph of f also allows us to picture the domain of f on the x-axis and its range on the y-axis as in Figure 5. 0 y = ƒ(x) domain range { x, ƒ} ƒ f(1) f(2) 0 1 2 x x x y y EXAMPLE 1 The graph of a function f is shown in Figure 6. (a) Find the values of f s1d and f s5d. (b) What are the domain and range of f ? SOLUTION (a) We see from Figure 6 that the point s1, 3d lies on the graph of f, so the value of f at 1 is f s1d - 3. (In other words, the point on the graph that lies above x - 1 is 3 units above the x-axis.) When x - 5, the graph lies about 0.7 units below the x-axis, so we estimate that f s5d< 20.7. (b) We see that f sxd is deined when 0 < x < 7, so the domain of f is the closed inter- val f0, 7g. Notice that f takes on all values from 22 to 4, so the range of f is h y | 22 < y < 4j - f22, 4g ■ x (input) ƒ (output) f FIGURE 2 Machine diagram for a function f f D E ƒ f(a) a x FIGURE 3 Arrow diagram for f FIGURE 4 FIGURE 5 x y 0 1 1 FIGURE 6 The notation for intervals is given in Appendix A.

","12 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph and ind the domain and range of each function. (a) f s xd - 2x 2 1 (b) ts xd - x 2 SOLUTION (a) The equation of the graph is y - 2x 2 1, and we recognize this as being the equa- tion of a line with slope 2 and y-intercept 21. (Recall the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line: y - mx 1 b. See Appendix B.) This enables us to sketch a portion of the graph of f in Figure 7. The expression 2x 2 1 is deined for all real numbers, so the domain of f is the set of all real numbers, which we denote by R. The graph shows that the range is also R. (b) Since ts2d - 2 2 - 4 and ts21d - s21d 2 - 1, we could plot the points s2, 4d and s21, 1d, together with a few other points on the graph, and join them to produce the graph (Figure 8). The equation of the graph is y - x 2 , which represents a parabola (see Appendix C). The domain of t is R. The range of t consists of all values of tsxd, that is, all numbers of the form x 2 . But x 2 > 0 for all numbers x and any positive number y is a square. So the range of t is h y | y > 0j - f0, `d. This can also be seen from Figure 8. ■ EXAMPLE 3 If f s xd - 2x 2 2 5x 1 1 and h ± 0, evaluate f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h . SOLUTION We irst evaluate f sa 1 hd by replacing x by a 1 h in the expression for f s xd: f sa 1 hd - 2sa 1 hd 2 2 5sa 1 hd 1 1 - 2s a 2 1 2ah 1 h 2 d 2 5sa 1 hd 1 1 - 2a 2 1 4ah 1 2h 2 2 5a 2 5h 1 1 Then we substitute into the given expression and simplify: f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h - s2a 2 1 4ah 1 2h 2 2 5a 2 5h 1 1d 2 s2a 2 2 5a 1 1d h - 2a 2 1 4ah 1 2h 2 2 5a 2 5h 1 1 2 2a 2 1 5a 2 1 h - 4ah 1 2h 2 2 5h h - 4a 1 2h 2 5 ■ Representations of Functions There are four possible ways to represent a function: ● verbally (by a description in words) ● numerically (by a table of values) ● visually (by a graph) ● algebraically (by an explicit formula) If a single function can be represented in all four ways, it’s often useful to go from one representation to another to gain additional insight into the function. (In Example 2, for instance, we started with algebraic formulas and then obtained the graphs.) But certain functions are described more naturally by one method than by another. With this in mind, let’s reexamine the four situations that we considered at the beginning of this section. x y=2x-1 0 -1 y 1 2 FIGURE 7 (_1, 1) (2, 4) 0 y 1 x 1 y=≈ FIGURE 8 The expression f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h in Example 3 is called a difference quotient and occurs frequently in calculus. As we will see in Chapter 2, it represents the average rate of change of f s xd between x - a and x - a 1 h. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The most useful representation of the area of a circle as a function of its radius is probably the algebraic formula Asrd - r 2 , though it is possible to compile a table of values or to sketch a graph (half a parabola). Because a circle has to have a posi- tive radius, the domain is hr | r . 0j - s0, `d, and the range is also s0, `d. B. We are given a description of the function in words: Pstd is the human population of the world at time t. Let’s measure t so that t - 0 corresponds to the year 1900. The table of values of world population provides a convenient representation of this func- tion. If we plot these values, we get the graph (called a scatter plot) in Figure 9. It too is a useful representation; the graph allows us to absorb all the data at once. What about a formula? Of course, it’s impossible to devise an explicit formula that gives the exact human population Pstd at any time t. But it is possible to ind an expression for a function that approximates Pstd. In fact, using methods explained in Section 1.2, we obtain the approximation Pstd< f std - s1.43653 3 10 9 d ∙ s1.01395d t Figure 10 shows that it is a reasonably good “it.” The function f is called a mathe- matical model for population growth. In other words, it is a function with an explicit formula that approximates the behavior of our given function. We will see, however, that the ideas of calculus can be applied to a table of values; an explicit formula is not necessary. 5x10' 5x10' P t 20 40 60 80 100 120 20 40 60 Years since 1900 Years since 1900 80 100 120 P t 0 0 FIGURE 9 FIGURE 10 The function P is typical of the functions that arise whenever we attempt to apply calculus to the real world. We start with a verbal description of a function. Then we may be able to construct a table of values of the function, perhaps from instrument readings in a scientiic experiment. Even though we don’t have complete knowledge of the values of the function, we will see throughout the book that it is still possible to perform the operations of calculus on such a function. C. Again the function is described in words: Let Cswd be the cost of mailing a large enve- lope with weight w. The rule that the US Postal Service used as of 2015 is as follows: The cost is 98 cents for up to 1 oz, plus 21 cents for each additional ounce (or less) up to 13 oz. The table of values shown in the margin is the most convenient repre- sentation for this function, though it is possible to sketch a graph (see Example 10). D. The graph shown in Figure 1 is the most natural representation of the vertical accel- eration function astd. It’s true that a table of values could be compiled, and it is even possible to devise an approximate formula.

","14 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models PS In setting up applied functions as in Example 5, it may be useful to review the principles of problem solving as discussed on page 71, particularly Step 1: Understand the Problem. know— amplitudes and patterns — can be seen easily from the graph. (The same is true for the patterns seen in electrocardiograms of heart patients and polygraphs for lie-detection.) In the next example we sketch the graph of a function that is deined verbally. EXAMPLE 4 When you turn on a hot-water faucet, the temperature T of the water depends on how long the water has been running. Draw a rough graph of T as a func- tion of the time t that has elapsed since the faucet was turned on. SOLUTION The initial temperature of the running water is close to room temperature because the water has been sitting in the pipes. When the water from the hot-water tank starts lowing from the faucet, T increases quickly. In the next phase, T is constant at the temperature of the heated water in the tank. When the tank is drained, T decreases to the temperature of the water supply. This enables us to make the rough sketch of T as a function of t in Figure 11. ■ In the following example we start with a verbal description of a function in a physical situation and obtain an explicit algebraic formula. The ability to do this is a useful skill in solving calculus problems that ask for the maximum or minimum values of quantities. EXAMPLE 5 A rectangular storage container with an open top has a volume of 10 m 3 . The length of its base is twice its width. Material for the base costs $10 per square meter; material for the sides costs $6 per square meter. Express the cost of mate- rials as a function of the width of the base. SOLUTION We draw a diagram as in Figure 12 and introduce notation by letting w and 2w be the width and length of the base, respectively, and h be the height. The area of the base is s2wdw - 2w 2 , so the cost, in dollars, of the material for the base is 10s2w 2 d. Two of the sides have area wh and the other two have area 2wh, so the cost of the material for the sides is 6f2swhd 1 2s2whdg. The total cost is therefore C - 10s2w 2 d 1 6f2swhd 1 2s2whdg - 20w 2 1 36wh To express C as a function of w alone, we need to eliminate h and we do so by using the fact that the volume is 10 m 3 . Thus ws2wdh - 10 which gives h - 10 2w 2 - 5 w 2 Substituting this into the expression for C, we have C - 20w 2 1 36w S 5 w 2 D - 20w 2 1 180 w Therefore the equation Cswd - 20w 2 1 180 w w . 0 expresses C as a function of w. ■ EXAMPLE 6 Find the domain of each function.

","SECTION 1.1 Four Ways to Represent a Function 15 SOLUTION (a) Because the square root of a negative number is not deined (as a real number), the domain of f consists of all values of x such that x 1 2 > 0. This is equivalent to x >22, so the domain is the interval f22, `d. (b) Since ts xd - 1 x 2 2 x - 1 x s x 2 1d and division by 0 is not allowed, we see that ts xd is not deined when x - 0 or x - 1. Thus the domain of t is h x | x ± 0, x ± 1j which could also be written in interval notation as s2`, 0d ø s0, 1d ø s1, `d ■ The graph of a function is a curve in the xy-plane. But the question arises: Which curves in the xy-plane are graphs of functions? This is answered by the following test. The Vertical Line Test A curve in the xy-plane is the graph of a function of x if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once. The reason for the truth of the Vertical Line Test can be seen in Figure 13. If each vertical line x - a intersects a curve only once, at sa, bd, then exactly one function value is deined by f sad - b. But if a line x - a intersects the curve twice, at sa, bd and sa, cd, then the curve can’t represent a function because a function can’t assign two different values to a. For example, the parabola x - y 2 2 2 shown in Figure 14(a) is not the graph of a function of x because, as you can see, there are vertical lines that intersect the parabola twice. The parabola, however, does contain the graphs of two functions of x. Notice that the equation x - y 2 2 2 implies y 2 - x 1 2, so y - 6sx 1 2 . Thus the upper and lower halves of the parabola are the graphs of the functions f s xd - sx 1 2 [from Example 6(a)] and ts xd - 2sx 1 2 . [See Figures 14(b) and (c).] We observe that if we reverse the roles of x and y, then the equation x - hs yd - y 2 2 2 does deine x as a function of y (with y as the independent variable and x as the depen- dent variable) and the parabola now appears as the graph of the function h.

Such functions are called piecewise deined functions. a x=a (a, b) 0 a (a, c) (a, b) x=a 0 x y x y (a) This curve represents a function. (b) This curve doesn’t represent a function.

","16 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models EXAMPLE 7 A function f is deined by f s xd - H 1 2 x x 2 if x <21 if x .21 Evaluate f s22d, f s21d, and f s0d and sketch the graph. SOLUTION Remember that a function is a rule. For this particular function the rule is the following: First look at the value of the input x. If it happens that x <21, then the value of f s xd is 1 2 x. On the other hand, if x .21, then the value of f s xd is x 2 . Since 22 <21, we have f s22d - 1 2 s22d - 3. Since 21 <21, we have f s21d - 1 2 s21d - 2. Since 0 .21, we have f s0d - 0 2 - 0. How do we draw the graph of f ? We observe that if x <21, then f s xd - 1 2 x, so the part of the graph of f that lies to the left of the vertical line x - 21 must coin- cide with the line y - 1 2 x, which has slope 21 and y-intercept 1. If x .21, then f s xd - x 2 , so the part of the graph of f that lies to the right of the line x - 21 must coincide with the graph of y - x 2 , which is a parabola. This enables us to sketch the graph in Figure 15. The solid dot indicates that the point s21, 2d is included on the graph; the open dot indicates that the point s21, 1d is excluded from the graph. ■ The next example of a piecewise deined function is the absolute value function. Recall that the absolute value of a number a, denoted by | a | , is the distance from a to 0 on the real number line. Distances are always positive or 0, so we have | a | > 0 for every number a For example, | 3 | - 3 | 23 | - 3 | 0 | - 0 | s2 2 1 | - s2 2 1 | 3 2  | -  2 3 In general, we have | a | - a if a > 0 | a | - 2a if a , 0 (Remember that if a is negative, then 2a is positive.) EXAMPLE 8 Sketch the graph of the absolute value function f s xd - | x | . SOLUTION From the preceding discussion we know that | x | - H x 2x if x > 0 if x , 0 Using the same method as in Example 7, we see that the graph of f coincides with the line y - x to the right of the y-axis and coincides with the line y - 2x to the left of the y-axis (see Figure 16). ■ 1 x y 1 _1 0 FIGURE 15 For a more extensive review of absolute values, see Appendix A. x y=|x| 0 y FIGURE 16 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 1.1 Four Ways to Represent a Function 17 Point-slope form of the equation of a line: y 2 y1 - ms x 2 x 1 d See Appendix B. EXAMPLE 9 Find a formula for the function f graphed in Figure 17. SOLUTION The line through s0, 0d and s1, 1d has slope m - 1 and y-intercept b - 0, so its equation is y - x. Thus, for the part of the graph of f that joins s0, 0d to s1, 1d, we have f s xd - x if 0 < x < 1 The line through s1, 1d and s2, 0d has slope m - 21, so its point-slope form is y 2 0 - s21dsx 2 2d or y - 2 2 x So we have f s xd - 2 2 x if 1 , x < 2 We also see that the graph of f coincides with the x-axis for x . 2. Putting this infor- mation together, we have the following three-piece formula for f : f sxd - H x 2 2 x 0 if 0 < x < 1 if 1 , x < 2 if x . 2 ■ EXAMPLE 10 In Example C at the beginning of this section we considered the cost Cswd of mailing a large envelope with weight w. In effect, this is a piecewise deined function because, from the table of values on page 13, we have Cswd - 0.98 1.19 1.40 1.61 if 0 , w < 1 if 1 , w < 2 if 2 , w < 3 if 3 , w < 4 ∙ ∙ ∙ The graph is shown in Figure 18. You can see why functions similar to this one are called step functions—they jump from one value to the next. Such functions will be studied in Chapter 2. ■ Symmetry If a function f satisies f s2xd - f s xd for every number x in its domain, then f is called an even function. For instance, the function f s xd - x 2 is even because f s2xd - s2xd 2 - x 2 - f s xd The geometric signiicance of an even function is that its graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis (see Figure 19). This means that if we have plotted the graph of f for x > 0, we obtain the entire graph simply by relecting this portion about the y-axis. If f satisies f s2xd - 2f s xd for every number x in its domain, then f is called an odd function. For example, the function f s xd - x 3 is odd because f s2xd - s2xd 3 - 2x 3 - 2f s xd x y 0 1 1 FIGURE 17 FIGURE 19 An even function 0 x _x f(_x) ƒ x y C 0.50 1.00 1.50 0 1 2 3 5 4 w FIGURE 18 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","18 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin (see Figure 20). If we already have the graph of f for x > 0, we can obtain the entire graph by rotating this portion through 180 8 about the origin. EXAMPLE 11 Determine whether each of the following functions is even, odd, or neither even nor odd. (a) f s xd - x 5 1 x (b) ts xd - 1 2 x 4 (c) hs xd - 2x 2 x 2 SOLUTION (a) f s2xd - s2xd 5 1 s2xd - s21d 5 x 5 1 s2xd - 2x 5 2 x - 2s x 5 1 xd - 2f s xd Therefore f is an odd function. (b) ts2xd - 1 2 s2xd 4 - 1 2 x 4 - ts xd So t is even. (c) hs2xd - 2s2xd 2 s2xd 2 - 22x 2 x 2 Since hs2xd ± hs xd and hs2xd ± 2hs xd, we conclude that h is neither even nor odd. ■ The graphs of the functions in Example 11 are shown in Figure 21.

A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions. The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about future behavior. Figure 1 illustrates the process of mathematical modeling. Given a real-world prob- lem, our irst task is to formulate a mathematical model by identifying and naming the independent and dependent variables and making assumptions that simplify the phenom- enon enough to make it mathematically tractable. We use our knowledge of the physical situation and our mathematical skills to obtain equations that relate the variables. In situations where there is no physical law to guide us, we may need to collect data (either from a library or the Internet or by conducting our own experiments) and examine the data in the form of a table in order to discern patterns. From this numerical representation of a function we may wish to obtain a graphical representation by plotting the data. The graph might even suggest a suitable algebraic formula in some cases. Real-world problem Mathematical model Real-world predictions Mathematical conclusions Test Formulate Solve Interpret The second stage is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that will be developed throughout this book) to the mathematical model that we have formulated in order to derive mathematical conclusions. Then, in the third stage, we take those mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the original real-world phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions. The inal step is to test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the predictions don’t compare well with reality, we need to reine our model or to formulate a new model and start the cycle again. A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical situation—it is an idealization. A good model simpliies reality enough to permit math- FIGURE 1 The modeling process Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In the end, Mother Nature has the inal say. There are many different types of functions that can be used to model relationships observed in the real world. In what follows, we discuss the behavior and graphs of these functions and give examples of situations appropriately modeled by such functions. Linear Models When we say that y is a linear function of x, we mean that the graph of the function is a line, so we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line to write a formula for the function as y - f s xd - mx 1 b where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. A characteristic feature of linear functions is that they grow at a constant rate. For instance, Figure 2 shows a graph of the linear function f s xd - 3x 2 2 and a table of sample values. Notice that whenever x increases by 0.1, the value of f s xd increases by 0.3. So f s xd increases three times as fast as x. Thus the slope of the graph y - 3x 2 2, namely 3, can be interpreted as the rate of change of y with respect to x. x y 0 y=3x-2 _2 1 x f s xd - 3x 2 2 1.0 1.0 1.1 1.3 1.2 1.6 1.3 1.9 1.4 2.2 1.5 2.5 EXAMPLE 1 (a) As dry air moves upward, it expands and cools.

(b) Draw the graph of the function in part (a). What does the slope represent? (c) What is the temperature at a height of 2.5 km? SOLUTION (a) Because we are assuming that T is a linear function of h, we can write T - mh 1 b We are given that T - 20 when h - 0, so 20 - m ? 0 1 b - b In other words, the y-intercept is b - 20. We are also given that T - 10 when h - 1, so 10 - m ? 1 1 20 The slope of the line is therefore m - 10 2 20 - 210 and the required linear function is T - 210h 1 20 The coordinate geometry of lines is reviewed in Appendix B.

A better linear model is obtained by a procedure from statistics called linear regression. If we use a graphing calculator, we enter the data from Table 1 into the data editor and choose the linear regression command. (With Maple we use the it[leastsquare] com- mand in the stats package; with Mathematica we use the Fit command.) The machine gives the slope and y-intercept of the regression line as m - 1.71262 b - 23054.14 So our least squares model for the CO 2 level is 2 C - 1.71262t 2 3054.14 In Figure 6 we graph the regression line as well as the data points.

","SECTION 1.2 Mathematical Models: A Catalog of Essential Functions 27 EXAMPLE 3 Use the linear model given by Equation 2 to estimate the average CO 2 level for 1987 and to predict the level for the year 2020. According to this model, when will the CO 2 level exceed 420 parts per million? SOLUTION Using Equation 2 with t - 1987, we estimate that the average CO 2 level in 1987 was Cs1987d - s1.71262ds1987d 2 3054.14 < 348.84 This is an example of interpolation because we have estimated a value between observed values. (In fact, the Mauna Loa Observatory reported that the average CO 2 level in 1987 was 348.93 ppm, so our estimate is quite accurate.) With t - 2020, we get Cs2020d - s1.71262ds2020d 2 3054.14 < 405.35 So we predict that the average CO 2 level in the year 2020 will be 405.4 ppm. This is an example of extrapolation because we have predicted a value outside the time frame of observations. Consequently, we are far less certain about the accuracy of our prediction. Using Equation 2, we see that the CO 2 level exceeds 420 ppm when 1.71262t 2 3054.14 . 420 Solving this inequality, we get t . 3474.14 1.71262 < 2028.55 We therefore predict that the CO 2 level will exceed 420 ppm by the year 2029. This prediction is risky because it involves a time quite remote from our observations. In fact, we see from Figure 6 that the trend has been for CO 2 levels to increase rather more rapidly in recent years, so the level might exceed 420 ppm well before 2029. ■ Polynomials A function P is called a polynomial if Ps xd - a n x n 1 a n21 x n21 1 ∙∙∙ 1 a 2 x 2 1 a 1 x 1 a 0 where n is a nonnegative integer and the numbers a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n are constants called the coeficients of the polynomial. The domain of any polynomial is R - s2`, `d. If the leading coeficient a n ± 0, then the degree of the polynomial is n. For example, the function Ps xd - 2x 6 2 x 4 1 2 5 x 3 1 s2 is a polynomial of degree 6. A polynomial of degree 1 is of the form Ps xd - mx 1 b and so it is a linear function. A polynomial of degree 2 is of the form Ps xd - ax 2 1 bx 1 c and is called a quadratic function. Its graph is always a parabola obtained by shifting the parabola y - ax 2 , as we will see in the next section. The parabola opens upward if a . 0 and downward if a , 0. (See Figure 7.) A polynomial of degree 3 is of the form Ps xd - ax 3 1 bx 2 1 cx 1 d a ± 0 FIGURE 7 The graphs of quadratic functions are parabolas. 0 y 2 x 1 (a) y=≈+x+1 y 2 x 1 (b) y=_2≈+3x+1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

For instance, in Section 3.7 we will explain why economists often use a polynomial Ps xd to represent the cost of producing x units of a commodity. In the fol- lowing example we use a quadratic function to model the fall of a ball. EXAMPLE 4 A ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the CN Tower, 450 m above the ground, and its height h above the ground is recorded at 1-second intervals in Table 2. Find a model to it the data and use the model to predict the time at which the ball hits the ground. SOLUTION We draw a scatter plot of the data in Figure 9 and observe that a linear model is inappropriate. But it looks as if the data points might lie on a parabola, so we try a quadratic model instead. Using a graphing calculator or computer algebra system (which uses the least squares method), we obtain the following quadratic model: 3 h - 449.36 1 0.96t 2 4.90t 2 2 200 400 4 6 8 t 0 200 400 t (seconds) 0 2 4 6 8 h h (meters) In Figure 10 we plot the graph of Equation 3 together with the data points and see that the quadratic model gives a very good it.

We consider several cases. (i) a - n, where n is a positive integer The graphs of f s xd - x n for n - 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are shown in Figure 11. (These are poly- nomials with only one term.)

If n is even, then f s xd - x n is an even function and its graph is similar to the parabola y - x 2 . If n is odd, then f s xd - x n is an odd function and its graph is similar to that of y - x 3 . Notice from Figure 12, however, that as n increases, the graph of y - x n becomes latter near 0 and steeper when | x | > 1. (If x is small, then x 2 is smaller, x 3 is even smaller, x 4 is smaller still, and so on.) y=x$ (1, 1) (_1, 1) y=x^ y=≈ (_1, _1) (1, 1) 0 y x x y 0 y=x# y=x% (ii) a - 1yn, where n is a positive integer The function f s xd - x 1yn - s n x is a root function. For n - 2 it is the square root function f s xd - sx , whose domain is f0, `d and whose graph is the upper half of the FIGURE 11 Graphs of f s xd - x n for n - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 A family of functions is a collection of functions whose equations are related.

[See Figure 13(a).] For other even values of n, the graph of y - s n x is similar to that of y - s x . For n - 3 we have the cube root function f s xd - s 3 x whose domain is R (recall that every real number has a cube root) and whose graph is shown in Figure 13(b). The graph of y - s n x for n odd sn . 3d is similar to that of y - s 3 x .

Its graph has the equation y - 1 yx, or xy - 1, and is a hyperbola with the coordinate axes as its asymptotes. This function arises in physics and chemistry in connection with Boyle’s Law, which says that, when the temperature is constant, the volume V of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure P: V - C P where C is a constant. Thus the graph of V as a function of P (see Figure 15) has the same general shape as the right half of Figure 14. Power functions are also used to model species-area relationships (Exercises 30–31), illumination as a function of distance from a light source (Exercise 29), and the period of revolution of a planet as a function of its distance from the sun (Exercise 32). Rational Functions A rational function f is a ratio of two polynomials: f s xd - Ps xd Qs xd where P and Q are polynomials. The domain consists of all values of x such that Qs xd ± 0. A simple example of a rational function is the function f s xd - 1 yx, whose domain is h x | x ± 0j; this is the reciprocal function graphed in Figure 14. The function f s xd - 2x 4 2 x 2 1 1 x 2 2 4 is a rational function with domain h x | x ± 62j. Its graph is shown in Figure 16. Algebraic Functions A function f is called an algebraic function if it can be constructed using algebraic operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking roots) start- ing with polynomials. Any rational function is automatically an algebraic function. Here are two more examples: f s xd - sx 2 1 1 ts xd - x 4 2 16x 2 x 1 sx 1 s x 2 2d s 3 x 1 1 FIGURE 13 Graphs of root functions x 1 y 1 0 y=∆ FIGURE 14 The reciprocal function P V 0 FIGURE 15 Volume as a function of pressure at constant temperature ƒ= 2x$-≈+1 ≈-4 x 20 y 2 0 FIGURE 16 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 1.2 Mathematical Models: A Catalog of Essential Functions 31 When we sketch algebraic functions in Chapter 4, we will see that their graphs can assume a variety of shapes.

The mass of a particle with velocity v is m - f svd - m 0 s1 2 v 2 yc 2 where m 0 is the rest mass of the particle and c - 3.0 3 10 5 kmys is the speed of light in a vacuum. Trigonometric Functions Trigonometry and the trigonometric functions are reviewed on Reference Page 2 and also in Appendix D. In calculus the convention is that radian measure is always used (except when otherwise indicated). For example, when we use the function f s xd - sin x, it is understood that sin x means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is x. Thus the graphs of the sine and cosine functions are as shown in Figure 18.

Thus, for all values of x, we have 21 < sin x < 1 21 < cos x < 1 or, in terms of absolute values, | sin x | < 1 | cos x | < 1 Also, the zeros of the sine function occur at the integer multiples of ; that is, sin x - 0 when x - n n an integer FIGURE 17 The Reference Pages are located at the back of the book.

This means that, for all values of x, sins x 1 2d - sin x coss x 1 2d - cos x The periodic nature of these functions makes them suitable for modeling repetitive phe- nomena such as tides, vibrating springs, and sound waves. For instance, in Example 1.3.4 we will see that a reasonable model for the number of hours of daylight in Philadelphia t days after January 1 is given by the function Lstd - 12 1 2.8 sin F 2 365 st 2 80d G EXAMPLE 5 What is the domain of the function f s x d - 1 1 2 2 cos x ?

So the domain of f is the set of all real numbers except for the ones noted above. ■ The tangent function is related to the sine and cosine functions by the equation tan x - sin x cos x and its graph is shown in Figure 19. It is undeined whenever cos x - 0, that is, when x - 6 y2, 63 y2, .... Its range is s2`, `d. Notice that the tangent function has period : tans x 1 d - tan x for all x The remaining three trigonometric functions (cosecant, secant, and cotangent) are the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. Their graphs are shown in Appendix D. Exponential Functions The exponential functions are the functions of the form f s xd - b x , where the base b is a positive constant. The graphs of y - 2 x and y - s0.5d x are shown in Figure 20. In both cases the domain is s2`, `d and the range is s0, `d. Exponential functions will be studied in detail in Section 1.4, and we will see that they are useful for modeling many natural phenomena, such as population growth (if b . 1) and radioactive decay (if b , 1d . Logarithmic Functions The logarithmic functions f s xd - log b x, where the base b is a positive constant, are the inverse functions of the exponential functions. They will be studied in Section 1.5.

Many physical quantities are connected by inverse square laws, that is, by power functions of the form f s xd - kx 22 . In particular, the illumination of an object by a light source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Suppose that after dark you are in a room with just one lamp and you are trying to read a book. The light is too dim and so you move halfway to the lamp. How much brighter is the light? 30. It makes sense that the larger the area of a region, the larger the number of species that inhabit the region. Many ecolo- gists have modeled the species-area relation with a power function and, in particular, the number of species S of bats living in caves in central Mexico has been related to the surface area A of the caves by the equation S - 0.7A 0.3 .

Transformations of Functions By applying certain transformations to the graph of a given function we can obtain the graphs of related functions. This will give us the ability to sketch the graphs of many functions quickly by hand. It will also enable us to write equations for given graphs. Let’s irst consider translations.

If c . 1, then the graph of y - cf s xd is the graph of y - f s xd stretched by a factor of c in the vertical direction (because each y-coordinate is multiplied by the same number c). The graph of y - 2f s xd is the graph of y - f s xd relected about the x-axis because the point s x, yd is replaced by the point s x, 2yd. (See Figure 2 and the following chart, where the results of other stretching, shrinking, and relecting transformations are also given.) Vertical and Horizontal Stretching and Relecting Suppose c . 1.

","40 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models SOLUTION Notice that each curve resembles a shifted and stretched sine function. By looking at the blue curve we see that, at the latitude of Philadelphia, daylight lasts about 14.8 hours on June 21 and 9.2 hours on December 21, so the amplitude of the curve (the factor by which we have to stretch the sine curve vertically) is 1 2 s14.8 2 9.2d - 2.8. By what factor do we need to stretch the sine curve horizontally if we measure the time t in days? Because there are about 365 days in a year, the period of our model should be 365. But the period of y - sin t is 2, so the horizontal stretching factor is 2y365. We also notice that the curve begins its cycle on March 21, the 80th day of the year, so we have to shift the curve 80 units to the right. In addition, we shift it 12 units upward. Therefore we model the length of daylight in Philadelphia on the tth day of the year by the function Lstd - 12 1 2.8 sin F 2 365 st 2 80d G ■ Another transformation of some interest is taking the absolute value of a function. If y - | f s xd | , then according to the deinition of absolute value, y - f s xd when f s xd > 0 and y - 2f s xd when f s xd , 0. This tells us how to get the graph of y - | f s xd | from the graph of y - f s xd: The part of the graph that lies above the x-axis remains the same; the part that lies below the x-axis is relected about the x-axis. EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the function y - | x 2 2 1 | . SOLUTION We irst graph the parabola y - x 2 2 1 in Figure 10(a) by shifting the parabola y - x 2 downward 1 unit. We see that the graph lies below the x-axis when 21 , x , 1, so we relect that part of the graph about the x-axis to obtain the graph of y - | x 2 2 1 | in Figure 10(b). ■ Combinations of Functions Two functions f and t can be combined to form new functions f 1 t, f 2 t, f t, and f y t in a manner similar to the way we add, subtract, multiply, and divide real numbers. The sum and difference functions are deined by s f 1 tds xd - f s xd 1 ts xd s f 2 tds xd - f s xd 2 ts xd If the domain of f is A and the domain of t is B, then the domain of f 1 t is the inter- section A > B because both f s xd and ts xd have to be deined. For example, the domain of f s xd - sx is A - f0, `d and the domain of ts xd - s2 2 x is B - s2`, 2g, so the domain of s f 1 tds xd - sx 1 s2 2 x is A > B - f0, 2g. Similarly, the product and quotient functions are deined by s f tds xd - f s xd ts xd S f t D s xd - f s xd ts xd The domain of f t is A > B, but we can’t divide by 0 and so the domain of f y t is h x [ A > B | ts xd ± 0j. For instance, if f s xd - x 2 and ts xd - x 2 1, then the domain of the rational function s f ytds xd - x 2 ys x 2 1d is h x | x ± 1j, or s2`, 1d ø s1, `d. There is another way of combining two functions to obtain a new function. For example, suppose that y - f sud - su and u - ts xd - x 2 1 1. Since y is a function of u and u is, in turn, a function of x, it follows that y is ultimately a function of x.

","SECTION 1.3 New Functions from Old Functions 41 We compute this by substitution: y - f sud - f s ts xdd - f s x 2 1 1d - sx 2 1 1 The procedure is called composition because the new function is composed of the two given functions f and t. In general, given any two functions f and t, we start with a number x in the domain of t and calculate ts xd. If this number ts xd is in the domain of f, then we can calculate the value of f s ts xdd. Notice that the output of one function is used as the input to the next function. The result is a new function hs xd - f s ts xdd obtained by substituting t into f. It is called the composition (or composite) of f and t and is denoted by f 8 t (“ f circle t ”). Deinition Given two functions f and t, the composite function f 8 t (also called the composition of f and t) is deined by s f 8 tds xd - f s ts xdd The domain of f 8 t is the set of all x in the domain of t such that ts xd is in the domain of f. In other words, s f 8 tds xd is deined whenever both ts xd and f s ts xdd are deined. Figure 11 shows how to picture f 8 t in terms of machines. EXAMPLE 6 If f s xd - x 2 and ts xd - x 2 3, ind the composite functions f 8 t and t 8 f. SOLUTION We have s f 8 tds xd - f s ts xdd - f s x 2 3d - s x 2 3d 2 s t 8 f ds xd - ts f s xdd - ts x 2 d - x 2 2 3 ■ NOTE You can see from Example 6 that, in general, f 8 t ± t 8 f. Remember, the notation f 8 t means that the function t is applied irst and then f is applied second. In Example 6, f 8 t is the function that irst subtracts 3 and then squares; t 8 f is the function that irst squares and then subtracts 3. EXAMPLE 7 If f s xd - sx and ts xd - s2 2 x , ind each of the following functions and their domains. (a) f 8 t (b) t 8 f (c) f 8 f (d) t 8 t SOLUTION (a) s f 8 tds xd - f s ts xdd - f (s2 2 x ) - ss2 2 x - s 4 2 2 x The domain of f 8 t is h x | 2 2 x > 0j - h x | x < 2j - s2`, 2g. (b) s t 8 f ds xd - ts f s xdd - t ( sx ) - s2 2 sx For sx to be deined we must have x > 0. For s2 2 sx to be deined we must have 2 2 sx > 0, that is, sx < 2, or x < 4. Thus we have 0 < x < 4, so the domain of t 8 f is the closed interval f0, 4g. (c) s f 8 f ds xd - f s f s xdd - f (sx ) - ssx - s 4 x The domain of f 8 f is f0, `d.

It should not be confused with the power function ts xd - x 2 , in which the variable is the base. In general, an exponential function is a function of the form f s xd - b x where b is a positive constant. Let’s recall what this means. If x - n, a positive integer, then b n - b ? b ? ∙∙∙ ? b n factors If x - 0, then b 0 - 1, and if x - 2n, where n is a positive integer, then b 2n - 1 b n represents a gradual increase in voltage or current in a circuit.

","46 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models If x is a rational number, x - p y q, where p and q are integers and q . 0, then b x - b pyq - s q b p - ss q b d p But what is the meaning of b x if x is an irrational number? For instance, what is meant by 2 s3 or 5  ? To help us answer this question we irst look at the graph of the function y - 2 x , where x is rational. A representation of this graph is shown in Figure 1. We want to enlarge the domain of y - 2 x to include both rational and irrational numbers. There are holes in the graph in Figure 1 corresponding to irrational values of x. We want to ill in the holes by deining f s xd - 2 x , where x [ R, so that f is an increasing function. In particular, since the irrational number s3 satisies 1.7 , s3 , 1.8 we must have 2 1.7 , 2 s3 , 2 1.8 and we know what 2 1.7 and 2 1.8 mean because 1.7 and 1.8 are rational numbers. Similarly, if we use better approximations for s3 , we obtain better approximations for 2 s3 : 1.73 , s3 , 1.74 ? 2 1.73 , 2 s3 , 2 1.74 1.732 , s3 , 1.733 ? 2 1.732 , 2 s3 , 2 1.733 1.7320 , s3 , 1.7321 ? 2 1.7320 , 2 s3 , 2 1.7321 1.73205 , s3 , 1.73206 ? 2 1.73205 , 2 s3 , 2 1.73206 . . . . . . . . . . . . It can be shown that there is exactly one number that is greater than all of the numbers 2 1.7 , 2 1.73 , 2 1.732 , 2 1.7320 , 2 1.73205 , . . . and less than all of the numbers 2 1.8 , 2 1.74 , 2 1.733 , 2 1.7321 , 2 1.73206 , . . . We deine 2 s3 to be this number. Using the preceding approximation process we can compute it correct to six decimal places: 2 s3 < 3.321997 Similarly, we can deine 2 x (or b x , if b . 0) where x is any irrational number.

Observe that if b ± 1, then the exponential function y - b x has domain R and range s0, `d. Notice also that, since s1 ybd x - 1 yb x - b 2x , the graph of y - s1 ybd x is just the relection of the graph of y - b x about the y-axis.

Here we indicate briely how it arises in the description of population growth and radioactive decay. In later chapters we will pursue these and other applications in greater detail. First we consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient medium. Suppose that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is determined that the population doubles every hour. If the number of bacteria at time t is pstd, where t is measured in hours, and the initial population is ps0d - 1000, then we have ps1d - 2ps0d - 2 3 1000 ps2d - 2ps1d - 2 2 3 1000 ps3d - 2ps2d - 2 3 3 1000 FIGURE 5 Example 2 shows that y - 2 x increases more quickly than y - x 2 . To demon- strate just how quickly f s xd - 2 x increases, let’s perform the following thought experiment. Suppose we start with a piece of paper a thousandth of an inch thick and we fold it in half 50 times. Each time we fold the paper in half, the thickness of the paper doubles, so the thickness of the resulting paper would be 2 50 y1000 inches. How thick do you think that is?

Figure 9 shows the graph of this exponential function together with the original data points. We see that the exponential curve its the data rea- sonably well.

So let’s model the function Vs t d by an exponential function. Using a graphing calculator or computer to it the data in Table 2 with an exponential function of the form y - a ? b t , we obtain the model V - 96.39785 ? s0.818656d t In Figure 11 we graph this exponential function with the data points and see that the model represents the viral load reasonably well for the irst month of treatment.

We also graph the line m - 5 and use the cursor to estimate that ms t d - 5 when t < 57. So the mass of the sample will be reduced to 5 mg after about 57 years. ■ The Number e Of all possible bases for an exponential function, there is one that is most convenient for the purposes of calculus. The choice of a base b is inluenced by the way the graph of y - b x crosses the y-axis. Figures 13 and 14 show the tangent lines to the graphs of y - 2 x and y - 3 x at the point s0, 1d. (Tangent lines will be deined precisely in Section 2.7. For present purposes, you can think of the tangent line to an exponential graph at a point as the line that touches the graph only at that point.)

(See Figure 15.) In fact, there is such a number and it is denoted by the letter e. (This notation was chosen by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1727, probably because it is the irst letter of the word exponential.) In view of Figures 13 and 14, it comes as no surprise that the number e lies between 2 and 3 and the graph of y - e x lies between the graphs of y - 2 x and y - 3 x . (See Figure 16.)

Suppose, however, that the biologist changes her point of view and becomes inter- ested in the time required for the population to reach various levels. In other words, she is thinking of t as a function of N. This function is called the inverse function of f , denoted by f 21 , and read “ f inverse.” Thus t - f 21 sN d is the time required for the population level to reach N.

","56 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models 1 Deinition A function f is called a one-to-one function if it never takes on the same value twice; that is, f s x 1 d ± f s x 2 d whenever x 1 ± x 2 In the language of inputs and outputs, this deinition says that f is one-to-one if each output corresponds to only one input. If a horizontal line intersects the graph of f in more than one point, then we see from Figure 2 that there are numbers x 1 and x 2 such that f s x 1 d - f s x 2 d. This means that f is not one-to-one. 0 ‡ fl y=ƒ y x / ¤ Therefore we have the following geometric method for determining whether a func- tion is one-to-one. Horizontal Line Test A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects its graph more than once. EXAMPLE 1 Is the function f s xd - x 3 one-to-one? SOLUTION 1 If x 1 ± x 2 , then x 3 1 ± x 3 2 (two different numbers can’t have the same cube). Therefore, by Deinition 1, f s xd - x 3 is one-to-one. SOLUTION 2 From Figure 3 we see that no horizontal line intersects the graph of f s xd - x 3 more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, f is one-to-one. ■ EXAMPLE 2 Is the function ts xd - x 2 one-to-one? SOLUTION 1 This function is not one-to-one because, for instance, ts1d - 1 - ts21d and so 1 and 21 have the same output. SOLUTION 2 From Figure 4 we see that there are horizontal lines that intersect the graph of t more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, t is not one-to-one. ■ One-to-one functions are important because they are precisely the functions that pos- sess inverse functions according to the following deinition. 2 Deinition Let f be a one-to-one function with domain A and range B. Then its inverse function f 21 has domain B and range A and is deined by f 21 s yd - x &? f s xd - y for any y in B. FIGURE 2 This function is not one-to-one because f s x1 d - f s x2 d.

","SECTION 1.5 Inverse Functions and Logarithms 57 This deinition says that if f maps x into y, then f 21 maps y back into x. (If f were not one-to-one, then f 21 would not be uniquely deined.) The arrow diagram in Figure 5 indicates that f 21 reverses the effect of f. Note that domain of f 21 - range of f range of f 21 - domain of f For example, the inverse function of f s xd - x 3 is f 21 s xd - x 1y 3 because if y - x 3 , then f 21 s yd - f 21 s x 3 d - s x 3 d 1y 3 - x CAUTION Do not mistake the 21 in f 21 for an exponent. Thus f 21 s xd does not mean 1 f s xd The reciprocal 1 yf s xd could, however, be written as f f s xdg 21 . EXAMPLE 3 If f s1d - 5, f s3d - 7, and f s8d - 210, ind f 21 s7d, f 21 s5d, and f 21 s210d. SOLUTION From the deinition of f 21 we have f 21 s7d - 3 because f s3d - 7 f 21 s5d - 1 because f s1d - 5 f 21 s210d - 8 because f s8d - 210 The diagram in Figure 6 makes it clear how f 21 reverses the effect of f in this case. ■ The letter x is traditionally used as the independent variable, so when we concentrate on f 21 rather than on f, we usually reverse the roles of x and y in Deinition 2 and write 3 f 21 s xd - y &? f s yd - x By substituting for y in Deinition 2 and substituting for x in (3), we get the follow- ing cancellation equations: 4 f 21 s f s xdd - x for every x in A f s f 21 s xdd - x for every x in B FIGURE 5 x y A B f–! f B 5 7 _10 f A 1 3 8 A 1 3 8 f–!

","58 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models The irst cancellation equation says that if we start with x, apply f, and then apply f 21 , we arrive back at x, where we started (see the machine diagram in Figure 7). Thus f 21 undoes what f does. The second equation says that f undoes what f 21 does. x x f ƒ f–! For example, if f s xd - x 3 , then f 21 s xd - x 1y 3 and so the cancellation equations become f 21 s f s xdd - s x 3 d 1y 3 - x f s f 21 s xdd - s x 1y3 d 3 - x These equations simply say that the cube function and the cube root function cancel each other when applied in succession. Now let’s see how to compute inverse functions. If we have a function y - f s xd and are able to solve this equation for x in terms of y, then according to Deinition 2 we must have x - f 21 s yd. If we want to call the independent variable x, we then interchange x and y and arrive at the equation y - f 21 s xd. 5 How to Find the Inverse Function of a One-to-One Function f STEP 1 Write y - f s xd. STEP 2 Solve this equation for x in terms of y (if possible). STEP 3 To express f 21 as a function of x, interchange x and y. The resulting equation is y - f 21 s xd. EXAMPLE 4 Find the inverse function of f s xd - x 3 1 2. SOLUTION According to (5) we irst write y - x 3 1 2 Then we solve this equation for x: x 3 - y 2 2 x - s 3 y 2 2 Finally, we interchange x and y: y - s 3 x 2 2 Therefore the inverse function is f 21 s xd - s 3 x 2 2 . ■ The principle of interchanging x and y to ind the inverse function also gives us the method for obtaining the graph of f 21 from the graph of f. Since f sad - b if and only if f 21 sbd - a, the point sa, bd is on the graph of f if and only if the point sb, ad is on the FIGURE 7 In Example 4, notice how f 21 reverses the effect of f .

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graphs of f s xd - s21 2 x and its inverse function using the same coordinate axes. SOLUTION First we sketch the curve y - s21 2 x (the top half of the parabola y 2 - 21 2 x, or x - 2y 2 2 1) and then we relect about the line y - x to get the graph of f 21 . (See Figure 10.) As a check on our graph, notice that the expression for f 21 is f 21 s xd - 2x 2 2 1, x > 0. So the graph of f 21 is the right half of the parabola y - 2x 2 2 1 and this seems reasonable from Figure 10. ■ Logarithmic Functions If b . 0 and b ± 1, the exponential function f s xd - b x is either increasing or decreasing and so it is one-to-one by the Horizontal Line Test. It therefore has an inverse function f 21 , which is called the logarithmic function with base b and is denoted by log b . If we use the formulation of an inverse function given by (3), f 21 s xd - y &? f s yd - x then we have 6 log b x - y &? b y - x Thus, if x . 0, then log b x is the exponent to which the base b must be raised to give x. For example, log 10 0.001 - 23 because 10 23 - 0.001.

Figure 11 shows the case where b . 1. (The most important logarithmic functions have base b . 1.) The fact that y - b x is a very rapidly increasing function for x . 0 is relected in the fact that y - log b x is a very slowly increasing function for x . 1. Figure 12 shows the graphs of y - log b x with various values of the base b . 1. Since log b 1 - 0, the graphs of all logarithmic functions pass through the point s1, 0d. 0 y 1 x 1 y=log£ x y=log™ x y=log∞ x y=log¡¸ x The following properties of logarithmic functions follow from the corresponding properties of exponential functions given in Section 1.4.

The logarithm with base e is called the natural logarithm and has a special notation: log e x - ln x If we put b - e and replace log e with “ln” in (6) and (7), then the deining properties of the natural logarithm function become FIGURE 11 0 y=x y=b®, b>1 y=log b x, b>1 y x FIGURE 12 Notation for Logarithms Most textbooks in calculus and the sciences, as well as calculators, use the notation ln x for the natural logarithm and log x for the “common logarithm,” log10 x.

Then, from (6), we have b y - x. Taking natural logarithms of both sides of this equation, we get y ln b - ln x. Therefore y - ln x ln b ■ Scientiic calculators have a key for natural logarithms, so Formula 10 enables us to use a calculator to compute a logarithm with any base (as shown in the following example). Similarly, Formula 10 allows us to graph any logarithmic function on a graph- ing calculator or computer (see Exercises 43 and 44). EXAMPLE 10 Evaluate log 8 5 correct to six decimal places. SOLUTION Formula 10 gives log 8 5 - ln 5 ln 8 < 0.773976 ■ Graph and Growth of the Natural Logarithm The graphs of the exponential function y - e x and its inverse function, the natural loga- rithm function, are shown in Figure 13. Because the curve y - e x crosses the y-axis with a slope of 1, it follows that the relected curve y - ln x crosses the x-axis with a slope of 1. In common with all other logarithmic functions with base greater than 1, the natural logarithm is an increasing function deined on s0, `d and the y-axis is a vertical asymp- tote. (This means that the values of ln x become very large negative as x approaches 0.) EXAMPLE 11 Sketch the graph of the function y - lns x 2 2d 2 1. SOLUTION We start with the graph of y - ln x as given in Figure 13. Using the transfor- mations of Section 1.3, we shift it 2 units to the right to get the graph of y - lns x 2 2d and then we shift it 1 unit downward to get the graph of y - lns x 2 2d 2 1.

You can see that initially the graphs of y - sx and y - ln x grow at comparable rates, but eventually the root function far surpasses the logarithm. x 1 2 5 10 50 100 500 1000 10,000 100,000 ln x 0 0.69 1.61 2.30 3.91 4.6 6.2 6.9 9.2 11.5 sx 1 1.41 2.24 3.16 7.07 10.0 22.4 31.6 100 316 ln x sx 0 0.49 0.72 0.73 0.55 0.46 0.28 0.22 0.09 0.04 x 0 y 1000 20 y=oe„ x y=ln x x 0 y 1 1 y=oe„ x y=ln x FIGURE 15 FIGURE 16 Inverse Trigonometric Functions When we try to ind the inverse trigonometric functions, we have a slight dificulty: Because the trigonometric functions are not one-to-one, they don’t have inverse func- tions. The dificulty is overcome by restricting the domains of these functions so that they become one-to-one. You can see from Figure 17 that the sine function y - sin x is not one-to-one (use the Horizontal Line Test). But the function f s xd - sin x, 2y2 < x < y2, is one-to- one (see Figure 18). The inverse function of this restricted sine function f exists and is denoted by sin 21 or arcsin. It is called the inverse sine function or the arcsine function. y 0 _π π x π 2 y=sin x 0 y x _ π 2 π 2 FIGURE 18 y - sin x, 2  2 < x <  2 FIGURE 17 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

EXAMPLE 12 Evaluate (a) sin 21 s 1 2 d and (b) tansarcsin 1 3 d. SOLUTION (a) We have sin 21 s 1 2 d -  6 because sinsy6d - 1 2 and y6 lies between 2y2 and y2. (b) Let  - arcsin 1 3 , so sin  - 1 3 . Then we can draw a right triangle with angle  as in Figure 19 and deduce from the Pythagorean Theorem that the third side has length s9 2 1 - 2 s2 .

The inverse cosine function is handled similarly. The restricted cosine function f s xd - cos x, 0 < x < , is one-to-one (see Figure 21) and so it has an inverse function denoted by cos 21 or arccos. cos 21 x - y &? cos y - x and 0 < y <  The cancellation equations are cos 21 scos xd - x for 0 < x <  cosscos 21 xd - x for 21 < x < 1 sin 21 x ± 1 sin x 2 oe„ 2 3 ¨ 1 FIGURE 19 0 y x 1 _1 π 2 _ π 2 FIGURE 20 y - sin 21 x - arcsin x FIGURE 21 y - cos x, 0 < x <  0 y x 1 π π 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 1.5 Inverse Functions and Logarithms 65 The inverse cosine function, cos 21 , has domain f21, 1g and range f0, g. Its graph is shown in Figure 22. The tangent function can be made one-to-one by restricting it to the interval s2y2, y2d. Thus the inverse tangent function is deined as the inverse of the func- tion f s xd - tan x, 2y2 , x , y2.

If y - tan 21 x, then tan y - x, and we can read from Figure 24 (which illustrates the case y . 0) that cosstan 21 xd - cos y - 1 s1 1 x 2 ■ The inverse tangent function, tan 21 - arctan, has domain R and range s2y2, y2d. Its graph is shown in Figure 25. π 2 _ π 2 y 0 x We know that the lines x - 6y2 are vertical asymptotes of the graph of tan. Since the graph of tan 21 is obtained by relecting the graph of the restricted tangent function about the line y - x, it follows that the lines y - y2 and y - 2y2 are horizontal asymptotes of the graph of tan 21 .

","71 Principles of Problem Solving There are no hard and fast rules that will ensure success in solving problems. However, it is possible to outline some general steps in the problem-solving process and to give some principles that may be useful in the solution of certain problems. These steps and principles are just common sense made explicit. They have been adapted from George Polya’s book How To Solve It. The irst step is to read the problem and make sure that you understand it clearly. Ask yourself the following questions: What is the unknown? What are the given quantities? What are the given conditions? For many problems it is useful to draw a diagram and identify the given and required quantities on the diagram. Usually it is necessary to introduce suitable notation In choosing symbols for the unknown quantities we often use letters such as a, b, c, m, n, x, and y, but in some cases it helps to use initials as suggestive symbols; for instance, V for volume or t for time. Find a connection between the given information and the unknown that will enable you to calculate the unknown. It often helps to ask yourself explicitly: “How can I relate the given to the unknown?” If you don’t see a connection immediately, the following ideas may be helpful in devising a plan. Try to Recognize Something Familiar Relate the given situation to previous knowledge. Look at the unknown and try to recall a more familiar problem that has a similar unknown. Try to Recognize Patterns Some problems are solved by recognizing that some kind of pattern is occurring. The pattern could be geometric, or numerical, or algebraic. If you can see regularity or repetition in a problem, you might be able to guess what the con- tinuing pattern is and then prove it. Use Analogy Try to think of an analogous problem, that is, a similar problem, a related problem, but one that is easier than the original problem. If you can solve the similar, simpler problem, then it might give you the clues you need to solve the original, more dificult problem. For instance, if a problem involves very large numbers, you could irst try a similar problem with smaller numbers. Or if the problem involves three-dimensional geometry, you could look for a similar problem in two-dimensional geometry. Or if the problem you start with is a general one, you could irst try a special case. Introduce Something Extra It may sometimes be necessary to introduce something new, an auxiliary aid, to help make the connection between the given and the unknown. For instance, in a problem where a diagram is useful the auxiliary aid could be a new line drawn in a diagram. In a more algebraic problem it could be a new unknown that is related to the original unknown. Take Cases We may sometimes have to split a problem into several cases and give a different argument for each of the cases. For instance, we often have to use this strategy in dealing with absolute value. 1 UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM 2 THINK OF A PLAN Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","72 Work Backward Sometimes it is useful to imagine that your problem is solved and work backward, step by step, until you arrive at the given data. Then you may be able to reverse your steps and thereby construct a solution to the original problem. This pro- cedure is commonly used in solving equations. For instance, in solving the equation 3x 2 5 - 7, we suppose that x is a number that satisies 3x 2 5 - 7 and work back- ward. We add 5 to each side of the equation and then divide each side by 3 to get x - 4. Since each of these steps can be reversed, we have solved the problem. Establish Subgoals In a complex problem it is often useful to set subgoals (in which the desired situation is only partially fulilled). If we can irst reach these subgoals, then we may be able to build on them to reach our inal goal. Indirect Reasoning Sometimes it is appropriate to attack a problem indirectly. In using proof by contradiction to prove that P implies Q, we assume that P is true and Q is false and try to see why this can’t happen. Somehow we have to use this information and arrive at a contradiction to what we absolutely know is true. Mathematical Induction In proving statements that involve a positive integer n, it is frequently helpful to use the following principle. Principle of Mathematical Induction Let Sn be a statement about the positive integer n. Suppose that 1. S1 is true. 2. Sk11 is true whenever Sk is true. Then Sn is true for all positive integers n. This is reasonable because, since S 1 is true, it follows from condition 2 swith k - 1d that S 2 is true. Then, using condition 2 with k - 2, we see that S 3 is true. Again using condition 2, this time with k - 3, we have that S 4 is true. This procedure can be followed indeinitely. In Step 2 a plan was devised. In carrying out that plan we have to check each stage of the plan and write the details that prove that each stage is correct. Having completed our solution, it is wise to look back over it, partly to see if we have made errors in the solution and partly to see if we can think of an easier way to solve the problem. Another reason for looking back is that it will familiarize us with the method of solution and this may be useful for solving a future problem. Descartes said, “Every problem that I solved became a rule which served afterwards to solve other problems.” These principles of problem solving are illustrated in the following examples. Before you look at the solutions, try to solve these problems yourself, referring to these Principles of Problem Solving if you get stuck. You may ind it useful to refer to this section from time to time as you solve the exercises in the remaining chapters of this book. EXAMPLE 1 Express the hypotenuse h of a right triangle with area 25 m 2 as a function of its perimeter P . SOLUTION Let’s irst sort out the information by identifying the unknown quantity and the data: Unknown: hypotenuse h Given quantities: perimeter P , area 25 m 2 3 CARRY OUT THE PLAN 4 LOOK BACK PS Understand the problem Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","73 It helps to draw a diagram and we do so in Figure 1. a h b In order to connect the given quantities to the unknown, we introduce two extra variables a and b, which are the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. This enables us to express the given condition, which is that the triangle is right-angled, by the Pythagorean Theorem: h 2 - a 2 1 b 2 The other connections among the variables come by writing expressions for the area and perimeter: 25 - 1 2 ab P - a 1 b 1 h Since P is given, notice that we now have three equations in the three unknowns a, b, and h: 1 h 2 - a 2 1 b 2 2 25 - 1 2 ab 3 P - a 1 b 1 h Although we have the correct number of equations, they are not easy to solve in a straightforward fashion. But if we use the problem-solving strategy of trying to recog- nize something familiar, then we can solve these equations by an easier method. Look at the right sides of Equations 1, 2, and 3. Do these expressions remind you of anything familiar? Notice that they contain the ingredients of a familiar formula: sa 1 bd 2 - a 2 1 2ab 1 b 2 Using this idea, we express sa 1 bd 2 in two ways. From Equations 1 and 2 we have sa 1 bd 2 - sa 2 1 b 2 d 1 2ab - h 2 1 4s25d From Equation 3 we have sa 1 bd 2 - sP 2 hd 2 - P 2 2 2Ph 1 h 2 Thus h 2 1 100 - P 2 2 2Ph 1 h 2 2Ph - P 2 2 100 h - P 2 2 100 2P This is the required expression for h as a function of P . ■ As the next example illustrates, it is often necessary to use the problem-solving prin- ciple of taking cases when dealing with absolute values. EXAMPLE 2 Solve the inequality | x 2 3 | 1 | x 1 2 | , 11.

So the solution is the interval s25, 6d. ■ In the following example we irst guess the answer by looking at special cases and recognizing a pattern. Then we prove our conjecture by mathematical induction. In using the Principle of Mathematical Induction, we follow three steps: Step 1 Prove that S n is true when n - 1. Step 2 Assume that S n is true when n - k and deduce that S n is true when n - k 1 1. Step 3 Conclude that S n is true for all n by the Principle of Mathematical Induction.

IN A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS (page 1) we saw how the idea of a limit underlies the various branches of calculus. It is therefore appropriate to begin our study of calculus by investigating limits and their properties.

","78 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives In this section we see how limits arise when we attempt to ind the tangent to a curve or the velocity of an object. The Tangent Problem The word tangent is derived from the Latin word tangens, which means “touching.” Thus a tangent to a curve is a line that touches the curve. In other words, a tangent line should have the same direction as the curve at the point of contact. How can this idea be made precise? For a circle we could simply follow Euclid and say that a tangent is a line that intersects the circle once and only once, as in Figure 1(a). For more complicated curves this deinition is inadequate. Figure l(b) shows two lines l and t passing through a point P on a curve C. The line l intersects C only once, but it certainly does not look like what we think of as a tangent. The line t, on the other hand, looks like a tangent but it intersects C twice. To be speciic, let’s look at the problem of trying to ind a tangent line t to the parabola y - x 2 in the following example. EXAMPLE 1 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola y - x 2 at the point Ps1, 1d. SOLUTION We will be able to ind an equation of the tangent line t as soon as we know its slope m. The dificulty is that we know only one point, P, on t, whereas we need two points to compute the slope. But observe that we can compute an approximation to m by choosing a nearby point Qs x, x 2 d on the parabola (as in Figure 2) and computing the slope m PQ of the secant line PQ. [A secant line, from the Latin word secans, meaning cutting, is a line that cuts (intersects) a curve more than once.] We choose x ± 1 so that Q ± P. Then m PQ - x 2 2 1 x 2 1 For instance, for the point Qs1.5, 2.25d we have m PQ - 2.25 2 1 1.5 2 1 - 1.25 0.5 - 2.5 The tables in the margin show the values of m PQ for several values of x close to 1. The closer Q is to P, the closer x is to 1 and, it appears from the tables, the closer m PQ is to 2. This suggests that the slope of the tangent line t should be m - 2. We say that the slope of the tangent line is the limit of the slopes of the secant lines, and we express this symbolically by writing lim Q lP m PQ - m and lim x l1 x 2 2 1 x 2 1 - 2 Assuming that the slope of the tangent line is indeed 2, we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line [y 2 y 1 - msx 2 x 1 d, see Appendix B] to write the equation of the tangent line through s1, 1d as y 2 1 - 2s x 2 1d or y - 2x 2 1 (a) (b) t P C t l FIGURE 1 x y 0 y=≈ t Q{ x, ≈} P(1, 1) FIGURE 2 x mPQ 2 3 1.5 2.5 1.1 2.1 1.01 2.01 1.001 2.001 x mPQ 0 1 0.5 1.5 0.9 1.9 0.99 1.99 0.999 1.999 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 2.1 The Tangent and Velocity Problems 79 Figure 3 illustrates the limiting process that occurs in this example.

The next example shows how to estimate the slope of the tangent line to the graph of such a function. EXAMPLE 2 The lash unit on a camera operates by storing charge on a capacitor and releasing it suddenly when the lash is set off. The data in the table describe the charge Q remaining on the capacitor (measured in microcoulombs) at time t (measured in seconds after the lash goes off). Use the data to draw the graph of this function and estimate the slope of the tangent line at the point where t - 0.04. [Note: The slope of the tangent line represents the electric current lowing from the capacitor to the lash bulb (measured in microamperes).] SOLUTION In Figure 4 we plot the given data and use them to sketch a curve that approximates the graph of the function. t Q 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 90 100 60 70 80 50 (seconds) (microcoulombs) FIGURE 3 TEC In Visual 2.1 you can see how the process in Figure 3 works for additional functions. t Q 0.00 100.00 0.02 81.87 0.04 67.03 0.06 54.88 0.08 44.93 0.10 36.76 FIGURE 4 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","80 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives Given the points Ps0.04, 67.03d and Rs0.00, 100.00d on the graph, we ind that the slope of the secant line PR is m PR - 100.00 2 67.03 0.00 2 0.04 - 2824.25 The table at the left shows the results of similar calculations for the slopes of other secant lines. From this table we would expect the slope of the tangent line at t - 0.04 to lie somewhere between 2742 and 2 607.5. In fact, the average of the slopes of the two closest secant lines is 1 2 s2742 2 607.5d - 2674.75 So, by this method, we estimate the slope of the tangent line to be about 2675. Another method is to draw an approximation to the tangent line at P and measure the sides of the triangle ABC, as in Figure 5. t Q A B C P 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 90 100 60 70 80 50 (seconds) (microcoulombs) This gives an estimate of the slope of the tangent line as 2 | AB | | BC | < 2 80.4 2 53.6 0.06 2 0.02 - 2670 ■ The Velocity Problem If you watch the speedometer of a car as you travel in city trafic, you see that the speed doesn’t stay the same for very long; that is, the velocity of the car is not constant. We assume from watching the speedometer that the car has a deinite velocity at each moment, but how is the “instantaneous” velocity deined? Let’s investigate the example of a falling ball. EXAMPLE 3 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the CN Tower in Toronto, 450 m above the ground. Find the velocity of the ball after 5 seconds. SOLUTION Through experiments carried out four centuries ago, Galileo discovered that the distance fallen by any freely falling body is proportional to the square of the time it has been falling. (This model for free fall neglects air resistance.) If the distance fallen R mPR (0.00, 100.00) 2824.25 (0.02, 81.87) 2742.00 (0.06, 54.88) 2607.50 (0.08, 44.93) 2552.50 (0.10, 36.76) 2504.50 FIGURE 5 The physical meaning of the answer in Example 2 is that the electric cur- rent lowing from the capacitor to the lash bulb after 0.04 seconds is about 2670 microamperes.

","SECTION 2.1 The Tangent and Velocity Problems 81 Steve Allen / Stockbyte / Getty Images The CN Tower in Toronto was the tallest freestanding building in the world for 32 years. after t seconds is denoted by sstd and measured in meters, then Galileo’s law is expressed by the equation sstd - 4.9t 2 The dificulty in inding the velocity after 5 seconds is that we are dealing with a single instant of time st - 5d, so no time interval is involved. However, we can approxi- mate the desired quantity by computing the average velocity over the brief time interval of a tenth of a second from t - 5 to t - 5.1: average velocity - change in position time elapsed - ss5.1d 2 ss5d 0.1 - 4.9s5.1d 2 2 4.9s5d 2 0.1 - 49.49 my s The following table shows the results of similar calculations of the average velocity over successively smaller time periods.

The instantaneous velocity when t - 5 is deined to be the limiting value of these average velocities over shorter and shorter time periods that start at t - 5. Thus it appears that the (instantaneous) velocity after 5 seconds is v - 49 mys ■ You may have the feeling that the calculations used in solving this problem are very similar to those used earlier in this section to ind tangents. In fact, there is a close connection between the tangent problem and the problem of inding velocities. If we draw the graph of the distance function of the ball (as in Figure 6) and we consider the points Psa, 4.9a 2 d and Qsa 1 h, 4.9sa 1 hd 2 d on the graph, then the slope of the secant line PQ is m PQ - 4.9sa 1 hd 2 2 4.9a 2 sa 1 hd 2 a which is the same as the average velocity over the time interval fa, a 1 hg. Therefore the velocity at time t - a (the limit of these average velocities as h approaches 0) must be equal to the slope of the tangent line at P (the limit of the slopes of the secant lines). Examples 1 and 3 show that in order to solve tangent and velocity problems we must be able to ind limits. After studying methods for computing limits in the next ive sec- tions, we will return to the problems of inding tangents and velocities in Section 2.7.

","SECTION 2.2 The Limit of a Function 83 Having seen in the preceding section how limits arise when we want to ind the tangent to a curve or the velocity of an object, we now turn our attention to limits in general and numerical and graphical methods for computing them. Let’s investigate the behavior of the function f deined by f s xd - x 2 2 x 1 2 for values of x near 2. The following table gives values of f s xd for values of x close to 2 but not equal to 2. x f sxd x f sxd 1.0 2.000000 3.0 8.000000 1.5 2.750000 2.5 5.750000 1.8 3.440000 2.2 4.640000 1.9 3.710000 2.1 4.310000 1.95 3.852500 2.05 4.152500 1.99 3.970100 2.01 4.030100 1.995 3.985025 2.005 4.015025 1.999 3.997001 2.001 4.003001 From the table and the graph of f (a parabola) shown in Figure 1 we see that the closer x is to 2 (on either side of 2), the closer f s xd is to 4. In fact, it appears that we can make the values of f s xd as close as we like to 4 by taking x suficiently close to 2. We express this by saying “the limit of the function f s xd - x 2 2 x 1 2 as x approaches 2 is equal to 4.” The notation for this is lim x l2 s x 2 2 x 1 2d - 4 In general, we use the following notation. 1 Intuitive Deinition of a Limit Suppose f s xd is deined when x is near the number a. (This means that f is deined on some open interval that contains a, except possibly at a itself.) Then we write lim x la f s xd - L and say “the limit of f s xd, as x approaches a, equals L” if we can make the values of f s xd arbitrarily close to L (as close to L as we like) by restricting x to be suficiently close to a (on either side of a) but not equal to a. Roughly speaking, this says that the values of f s xd approach L as x approaches a. In other words, the values of f s xd tend to get closer and closer to the number L as x gets closer and closer to the number a (from either side of a) but x ± a. (A more precise dei- nition will be given in Section 2.4.) An alternative notation for lim x la f s xd - L is f s xd l L as x l a which is usually read “ f s xd approaches L as x approaches a.” FIGURE 1 4 ƒ approaches 4. x y 2 As x approaches 2, y=≈-x+2 0 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","84 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives Notice the phrase “but x ± a” in the deinition of limit. This means that in inding the limit of f s xd as x approaches a, we never consider x - a. In fact, f s xd need not even be deined when x - a. The only thing that matters is how f is deined near a. Figure 2 shows the graphs of three functions. Note that in part (c), f sad is not deined and in part (b), f sad ± L. But in each case, regardless of what happens at a, it is true that lim x l a f s xd - L. (c) x y 0 L a (b) x y 0 L a (a) x y 0 L a EXAMPLE 1 Guess the value of lim x l1 x 2 1 x 2 2 1 . SOLUTION Notice that the function f s xd - s x 2 1dys x 2 2 1d is not deined when x - 1, but that doesn’t matter because the deinition of lim x l a f s xd says that we consider values of x that are close to a but not equal to a. The tables at the left give values of f s xd (correct to six decimal places) for values of x that approach 1 (but are not equal to 1). On the basis of the values in the tables, we make the guess that lim x l1 x 2 1 x 2 2 1 - 0.5 ■ Example 1 is illustrated by the graph of f in Figure 3. Now let’s change f slightly by giving it the value 2 when x - 1 and calling the resulting function t: t sxd - H x 2 1 x 2 2 1 if x ± 1 2 if x - 1 This new function t still has the same limit as x approaches 1.

","SECTION 2.2 The Limit of a Function 85 EXAMPLE 2 Estimate the value of lim t l0 st 2 1 9 2 3 t 2 . SOLUTION The table lists values of the function for several values of t near 0. t st 2 1 9 2 3 t 2 61.0 0.162277 . . . 60.5 0.165525 . . . 60.1 0.166620 . . . 60.05 0.166655 . . . 60.01 0.166666 . . . As t approaches 0, the values of the function seem to approach 0.1666666 . . . and so we guess that lim t l0 st 2 1 9 2 3 t 2 - 1 6 ■ In Example 2 what would have happened if we had taken even smaller values of t ? The table in the margin shows the results from one calculator; you can see that something strange seems to be happening. If you try these calculations on your own calculator you might get different values, but eventually you will get the value 0 if you make t suficiently small. Does this mean that the answer is really 0 instead of 1 6 ? No, the value of the limit is 1 6 , as we will show in the next section. The problem is that the calculator gave false values because st 2 1 9 is very close to 3 when t is small. (In fact, when t is suficiently small, a calculator’s value for st 2 1 9 is 3.000. . . to as many digits as the calculator is capable of carrying.) Something similar happens when we try to graph the function f std - st 2 1 9 2 3 t 2 of Example 2 on a graphing calculator or computer. Parts (a) and (b) of Figure 5 show quite accurate graphs of f , and when we use the trace mode (if available) we can estimate easily that the limit is about 1 6 . But if we zoom in too much, as in parts (c) and (d), then we get inaccurate graphs, again because of rounding errors from the subtraction. 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.2 sad 25 < t < 5 sbd 20.1 < t < 0.1 scd 210 26 < t < 10 26 sdd 210 27 < t < 10 27 t st 2 1 9 2 3 t 2 60.001 0.166667 60.0001 0.166670 60.00001 0.167000 60.000001 0.000000 www.stewartcalculus.com For a further explanation of why calculators sometimes give false values, click on Lies My Calculator and Computer Told Me.

","86 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives EXAMPLE 3 Guess the value of lim x l 0 sin x x . SOLUTION The function f s xd - ssin xdyx is not deined when x - 0. Using a calcula- tor (and remembering that, if x [ R, sin x means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is x), we construct a table of values correct to eight decimal places. From the table at the left and the graph in Figure 6 we guess that lim x l 0 sin x x - 1 This guess is in fact correct, as will be proved in Chapter 3 using a geometric argument. 0 x _1 1 y sin x x y= 1 ■ EXAMPLE 4 Investigate lim x l 0 sin  x . SOLUTION Again the function f s xd - sinsyxd is undeined at 0. Evaluating the function for some small values of x, we get f s1d - sin  - 0 f ( 1 2 ) - sin 2 - 0 f ( 1 3 ) - sin 3 - 0 f ( 1 4 ) - sin 4 - 0 f s0.1d - sin 10 - 0 f s0.01d - sin 100 - 0 Similarly, f s0.001d - f s0.0001d - 0. On the basis of this information we might be tempted to guess that lim x l 0 sin  x - 0 but this time our guess is wrong. Note that although f s1 ynd - sin n - 0 for any integer n, it is also true that f s xd - 1 for ininitely many values of x (such as 2y5 or 2y101) that approach 0. You can see this from the graph of f shown in Figure 7. y=sin(π/x) x y 1 1 _1 _1 x sin x x 61.0 0.84147098 60.5 0.95885108 60.4 0.97354586 60.3 0.98506736 60.2 0.99334665 60.1 0.99833417 60.05 0.99958339 60.01 0.99998333 60.005 0.99999583 60.001 0.99999983 FIGURE 6 Computer Algebra Systems Computer algebra systems (CAS) have commands that compute limits. In order to avoid the types of pitfalls demonstrated in Examples 2, 4, and 5, they don’t ind limits by numerical experimentation. Instead, they use more sophisticated techniques such as com- puting ininite series. If you have access to a CAS, use the limit command to compute the limits in the examples of this section and to check your answers in the exercises of this chapter.

","SECTION 2.2 The Limit of a Function 87 The dashed lines near the y-axis indicate that the values of sinsyxd oscillate between 1 and 21 ininitely often as x approaches 0. (See Exercise 51.) Since the values of f s xd do not approach a ixed number as x approaches 0, lim x l 0 sin  x does not exist ■ EXAMPLE 5 Find lim x l0 S x 3 1 cos 5x 10,000 D . SOLUTION As before, we construct a table of values. From the irst table in the margin it appears that lim x l0 S x 3 1 cos 5x 10,000 D - 0 But if we persevere with smaller values of x, the second table suggests that lim x l 0 S x 3 1 cos 5x 10,000 D - 0.000100 - 1 10,000 Later we will see that lim x l 0 cos 5x - 1; then it follows that the limit is 0.0001. ■ Examples 4 and 5 illustrate some of the pitfalls in guessing the value of a limit. It is easy to guess the wrong value if we use inappropriate values of x, but it is dificult to know when to stop calculating values. And, as the discussion after Example 2 shows, sometimes calculators and computers give the wrong values. In the next section, how- ever, we will develop foolproof methods for calculating limits. One-Sided Limits EXAMPLE 6 The Heaviside function H is deined by Hstd - H 0 1 if t , 0 if t > 0 [This function is named after the electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925) and can be used to describe an electric current that is switched on at time t - 0.] Its graph is shown in Figure 8. As t approaches 0 from the left, Hstd approaches 0. As t approaches 0 from the right, Hstd approaches 1. There is no single number that Hstd approaches as t approaches 0. Therefore lim t l 0 Hstd does not exist. ■ We noticed in Example 6 that Hstd approaches 0 as t approaches 0 from the left and Hstd approaches 1 as t approaches 0 from the right. We indicate this situation symboli- cally by writing lim t l0 2 Hstd - 0 and lim t l 0 1 Hstd - 1 The notation t l 0 2 indicates that we consider only values of t that are less than 0. Like- wise, t l 0 1 indicates that we consider only values of t that are greater than 0. x x 3 1 cos 5x 10,000 1 1.000028 0.5 0.124920 0.1 0.001088 0.05 0.000222 0.01 0.000101 x x 3 1 cos 5x 10,000 0.005 0.00010009 0.001 0.00010000 t y 1 0 FIGURE 8 The Heaviside function Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","88 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives 2 Deinition of One-Sided Limits We write lim x la 2 f s xd - L and say the left-hand limit of f s xd as x approaches a [or the limit of f s xd as x approaches a from the left] is equal to L if we can make the values of f s xd arbitrarily close to L by taking x to be suficiently close to a with x less than a. Notice that Deinition 2 differs from Deinition 1 only in that we require x to be less than a. Similarly, if we require that x be greater than a, we get “the right-hand limit of f s xd as x approaches a is equal to L” and we write lim x la 1 f s xd - L Thus the notation x l a 1 means that we consider only x greater than a. These deini- tions are illustrated in Figure 9. 0 x y L x a 0 x y ƒ L x a ƒ x a + x a _ (a) lim ƒ=L (b) lim ƒ=L By comparing Deinition l with the deinitions of one-sided limits, we see that the following is true. 3 lim x la f s xd - L if and only if lim x la 2 f s xd - L and lim x la 1 f s xd - L EXAMPLE 7 The graph of a function t is shown in Figure 10. Use it to state the values (if they exist) of the following: (a) lim x l2 2 ts xd (b) lim x l2 1 ts xd (c) lim x l2 ts xd (d) lim x l5 2 ts xd (e) lim x l5 1 ts xd (f ) lim x l5 ts xd SOLUTION From the graph we see that the values of ts xd approach 3 as x approaches 2 from the left, but they approach 1 as x approaches 2 from the right. Therefore (a) lim x l2 2 ts xd - 3 and (b) lim x l2 1 ts xd - 1 (c) Since the left and right limits are different, we conclude from (3) that lim x l2 ts xd does not exist. The graph also shows that (d) lim x l5 2 ts xd - 2 and (e) lim x l5 1 ts xd - 2 FIGURE 9 FIGURE 10 y 0 x y=© 1 2 3 4 5 1 3 4 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 2.2 The Limit of a Function 89 (f) This time the left and right limits are the same and so, by (3), we have lim x l5 ts xd - 2 Despite this fact, notice that ts5d ± 2. ■ Infinite Limits EXAMPLE 8 Find lim x l0 1 x 2 if it exists. SOLUTION As x becomes close to 0, x 2 also becomes close to 0, and 1 yx 2 becomes very large. (See the table in the margin.) In fact, it appears from the graph of the function f s xd - 1 yx 2 shown in Figure 11 that the values of f s xd can be made arbitrarily large by taking x close enough to 0. Thus the values of f s xd do not approach a number, so lim x l0 s1 yx 2 d does not exist. ■ To indicate the kind of behavior exhibited in Example 8, we use the notation lim x l 0 1 x 2 - ` This does not mean that we are regarding ` as a number. Nor does it mean that the limit exists. It simply expresses the particular way in which the limit does not exist: 1 yx 2 can be made as large as we like by taking x close enough to 0. In general, we write symbolically lim x l a f s xd - ` to indicate that the values of f s xd tend to become larger and larger (or “increase without bound”) as x becomes closer and closer to a. 4 Intuitive Deinition of an Ininite Limit Let f be a function deined on both sides of a, except possibly at a itself. Then lim x l a f s xd - ` means that the values of f s xd can be made arbitrarily large (as large as we please) by taking x suficiently close to a, but not equal to a. Another notation for lim x la f s xd - ` is f s xd l ` as x l a Again, the symbol ` is not a number, but the expression lim x l a f s xd - ` is often read as “the limit of f s xd, as x approaches a, is ininity” or “ f s xd becomes ininite as x approaches a” or “ f s xd increases without bound as x approaches a” This deinition is illustrated graphically in Figure 12. x 1 x 2 61 1 60.5 4 60.2 25 60.1 100 60.05 400 60.01 10,000 60.001 1,000,000 FIGURE 11 y= 0 y x 1 ≈ FIGURE 12 lim x la f s xd - ` x y x=a y=ƒ a 0 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","90 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives A similar sort of limit, for functions that become large negative as x gets close to a, is deined in Deinition 5 and is illustrated in Figure 13. 5 Deinition Let f be a function deined on both sides of a, except possibly at a itself. Then lim x l a f s xd - 2` means that the values of f s xd can be made arbitrarily large negative by taking x suficiently close to a, but not equal to a. The symbol lim x la f s xd - 2` can be read as “the limit of f s xd, as x approaches a, is negative ininity” or “ f s xd decreases without bound as x approaches a.” As an example we have lim x l0 S 2 1 x 2 D - 2` Similar deinitions can be given for the one-sided ininite limits lim x la 2 f s xd - ` lim x la 1 f s xd - ` lim x la 2 f s xd - 2` lim x la 1 f s xd - 2` remembering that x l a 2 means that we consider only values of x that are less than a, and similarly x l a 1 means that we consider only x . a.

In general, knowledge of vertical asymptotes is very useful in sketching graphs. EXAMPLE 9 Find lim x l3 1 2x x 2 3 and lim x l3 2 2x x 2 3 . SOLUTION If x is close to 3 but larger than 3, then the denominator x 2 3 is a small positive number and 2x is close to 6. So the quotient 2x ys x 2 3d is a large positive number. [For instance, if x - 3.01 then 2x ys x 2 3d - 6.02y0.01 - 602.] Thus, intui- tively, we see that lim x l3 1 2x x 2 3 - ` Likewise, if x is close to 3 but smaller than 3, then x 2 3 is a small negative number but 2x is still a positive number (close to 6). So 2x ys x 2 3d is a numerically large nega- tive number. Thus lim x l3 2 2x x 2 3 - 2` The graph of the curve y - 2x ys x 2 3d is given in Figure 15. The line x - 3 is a verti- cal asymptote. ■ EXAMPLE 10 Find the vertical asymptotes of f s xd - tan x. SOLUTION Because tan x - sin x cos x there are potential vertical asymptotes where cos x - 0. In fact, since cos x l 0 1 as x l sy2d 2 and cos x l 0 2 as x l sy2d 1 , whereas sin x is positive (near 1) when x is near y2, we have lim x lsy2d 2 tan x - ` and lim x lsy2d 1 tan x - 2` This shows that the line x - y2 is a vertical asymptote. Similar reasoning shows that the lines x - y2 1 n, where n is an integer, are all vertical asymptotes of f s xd - tan x. The graph in Figure 16 conirms this. ■ Another example of a function whose graph has a vertical asymptote is the natural logarithmic function y - ln x. From Figure 17 we see that lim x l0 1 ln x - 2` and so the line x - 0 (the y-axis) is a vertical asymptote. In fact, the same is true for y - log b x provided that b . 1.

","SECTION 2.3 Calculating Limits Using the Limit Laws 95 In Section 2.2 we used calculators and graphs to guess the values of limits, but we saw that such methods don’t always lead to the correct answer. In this section we use the fol- lowing properties of limits, called the Limit Laws, to calculate limits. Limit Laws Suppose that c is a constant and the limits lim x la f s xd and lim x la ts xd exist. Then 1. lim x la f f s xd 1 ts xdg - lim x la f s xd 1 lim x la ts xd 2. lim x la f f s xd 2 ts xdg - lim x la f s xd 2 lim x la ts xd 3. lim x la fcf s xdg - c lim x la f s xd 4. lim x la f f s xd ts xdg - lim x la f s xd ? lim x la ts xd 5. lim x la f s xd ts xd - lim x la f s xd lim xla ts xd if lim x la ts xd ± 0 These ive laws can be stated verbally as follows: 1. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. 2. The limit of a difference is the difference of the limits. 3. The limit of a constant times a function is the constant times the limit of the function. 4. The limit of a product is the product of the limits. 5. The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits (provided that the limit of the denominator is not 0). It is easy to believe that these properties are true. For instance, if f s xd is close to L and ts xd is close to M, it is reasonable to conclude that f s xd 1 ts xd is close to L 1 M. This gives us an intuitive basis for believing that Law 1 is true. In Section 2.4 we give a precise deinition of a limit and use it to prove this law. The proofs of the remaining laws are given in Appendix F. EXAMPLE 1 Use the Limit Laws and the graphs of f and t in Figure 1 to evaluate the following limits, if they exist. (a) lim x l22 f f s xd 1 5ts xdg (b) lim x l1 f f s xd ts xdg (c) lim x l2 f s xd ts xd SOLUTION (a) From the graphs of f and t we see that lim x l22 f s xd - 1 and lim x l22 ts xd - 21 Sum Law Diference Law Constant Multiple Law Product Law Quotient Law x y 0 f g 1 1 FIGURE 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","96 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives Therefore we have lim x l22 f f s xd 1 5ts xdg - lim x l22 f s xd 1 lim x l22 f5ts xdg (by Limit Law 1) - lim x l22 f s xd 1 5 lim x l22 ts xd (by Limit Law 3) - 1 1 5s21d - 24 (b) We see that lim x l1 f s xd - 2. But lim x l1 ts xd does not exist because the left and right limits are different: lim x l1 2 t s xd - 22 lim x l1 1 t s xd - 21 So we can’t use Law 4 for the desired limit. But we can use Law 4 for the one-sided limits: lim x l1 2 f f s xd ts xdg - lim x l1 2 f s xd ? lim x l1 2 ts xd - 2 ? s22d - 24 lim x l1 1 f f s xd ts xdg - lim x l1 1 f s xd ? lim x l1 1 ts xd - 2 ? s21d - 22 The left and right limits aren’t equal, so lim x l1 f f s xd t s xdg does not exist. (c) The graphs show that lim x l2 f s xd< 1.4 and lim x l2 ts xd - 0 Because the limit of the denominator is 0, we can’t use Law 5. The given limit does not exist because the denominator approaches 0 while the numerator approaches a nonzero number. ■ If we use the Product Law repeatedly with ts xd - f s xd, we obtain the following law. 6. lim x la f f s xdg n - f lim x la f s xd g n where n is a positive integer In applying these six limit laws, we need to use two special limits: 7. lim x la c - c 8. lim x la x - a These limits are obvious from an intuitive point of view (state them in words or draw graphs of y - c and y - x), but proofs based on the precise deinition are requested in the exercises for Section 2.4. If we now put f s xd - x in Law 6 and use Law 8, we get another useful special limit. 9. lim x l a x n - a n where n is a positive integer A similar limit holds for roots as follows. (For square roots the proof is outlined in Exercise 2.4.37.) 10. lim x la s n x - s n a where n is a positive integer (If n is even, we assume that a . 0.) Power Law Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 2.3 Calculating Limits Using the Limit Laws 97 Newton and Limits Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day in 1642, the year of Galileo’s death. When he entered Cambridge University in 1661 Newton didn’t know much mathematics, but he learned quickly by reading Euclid and Descartes and by attending the lectures of Isaac Barrow. Cambridge was closed because of the plague in 1665 and 1666, and Newton returned home to relect on what he had learned. Those two years were amazingly productive for at that time he made four of his major discoveries: (1) his representation of functions as sums of ininite series, including the binomial theorem; (2) his work on difer- ential and integral calculus; (3) his laws of motion and law of universal gravita- tion; and (4) his prism experiments on the nature of light and color. Because of a fear of controversy and criticism, he was reluctant to publish his discoveries and it wasn’t until 1687, at the urging of the astronomer Halley, that Newton published Principia Mathematica. In this work, the greatest scientiic treatise ever written, Newton set forth his ver- sion of calculus and used it to investi- gate mechanics, luid dynamics, and wave motion, and to explain the motion of planets and comets. The beginnings of calculus are found in the calculations of areas and volumes by ancient Greek scholars such as Eudoxus and Archimedes. Although aspects of the idea of a limit are implicit in their “method of exhaustion,” Eudoxus and Archimedes never explicitly formu- lated the concept of a limit. Likewise, mathematicians such as Cavalieri, Fer- mat, and Barrow, the immediate precur- sors of Newton in the development of calculus, did not actually use limits. It was Isaac Newton who was the irst to talk explicitly about limits. He explained that the main idea behind limits is that quantities “approach nearer than by any given diference.” Newton stated that the limit was the basic concept in calculus, but it was left to later mathe- maticians like Cauchy to clarify his ideas about limits. More generally, we have the following law, which is proved in Section 2.5 as a con- sequence of Law 10. 11. lim x la s n f sxd - s n lim x la f sxd where n is a positive integer f If n is even, we assume that lim x la f s xd . 0. g EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate the following limits and justify each step.

In other words, we would have gotten the correct answer in Example 2(a) by substituting 5 for x. Similarly, direct substitution provides the correct answer in part (b). The functions in Example 2 are a polynomial and a rational function, respectively, and similar use of the Limit Laws proves that direct substitution always works for such functions (see Exercises 57 and 58). We state this fact as follows.

","98 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives Functions with the Direct Substitution Property are called continuous at a and will be studied in Section 2.5. However, not all limits can be evaluated by direct substitution, as the following examples show. EXAMPLE 3 Find lim xl1 x 2 2 1 x 2 1 . SOLUTION Let f s xd - s x 2 2 1dys x 2 1d. We can’t ind the limit by substituting x - 1 because f s1d isn’t deined. Nor can we apply the Quotient Law, because the limit of the denominator is 0. Instead, we need to do some preliminary algebra. We factor the numerator as a difference of squares: x 2 2 1 x 2 1 - s x 2 1ds x 1 1d x 2 1 The numerator and denominator have a common factor of x 2 1. When we take the limit as x approaches 1, we have x ± 1 and so x 2 1 ± 0. Therefore we can cancel the common factor and then compute the limit by direct substitution as follows: lim x l1 x 2 2 1 x 2 1 - lim x l1 s x 2 1ds x 1 1d x 2 1 - lim x l1 s x 1 1d - 1 1 1 - 2 The limit in this example arose in Example 2.1.1 when we were trying to ind the tangent to the parabola y - x 2 at the point s1, 1d. ■ NOTE In Example 3 we were able to compute the limit by replacing the given func- tion f s xd - s x 2 2 1dys x 2 1d by a simpler function, tsxd - x 1 1, with the same limit. This is valid because f s xd - tsxd except when x - 1, and in computing a limit as x approaches 1 we don’t consider what happens when x is actually equal to 1. In general, we have the following useful fact. If f s xd - t s xd when x ± a, then lim x la f s xd - lim x la t s xd, provided the limits exist. EXAMPLE 4 Find lim x l1 ts xd where tsxd - H x 1 1  if x ± 1 if x - 1 SOLUTION Here t is deined at x - 1 and ts1d - , but the value of a limit as x approaches 1 does not depend on the value of the function at 1. Since ts xd - x 1 1 for x ± 1, we have lim x l1 ts xd - lim x l1 s x 1 1d - 2 ■ Note that the values of the functions in Examples 3 and 4 are identical except when x - 1 (see Figure 2) and so they have the same limit as x approaches 1. Notice that in Example 3 we do not have an ininite limit even though the denominator approaches 0 as x l 1. When both numerator and denominator approach 0, the limit may be ininite or it may be some inite value. y=© 1 2 3 1 x y 0 2 3 y=ƒ 1 2 3 1 x y 0 2 3 FIGURE 2 The graphs of the functions f (from Example 3) and t (from Example 4) Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

SOLUTION If we deine Fshd - s3 1 hd 2 2 9 h then, as in Example 3, we can’t compute lim h l 0 Fshd by letting h - 0 since Fs0d is undeined. But if we simplify Fshd algebraically, we ind that Fshd - s9 1 6h 1 h 2 d 2 9 h - 6h 1 h 2 h - hs6 1 hd h - 6 1 h (Recall that we consider only h ± 0 when letting h approach 0.)

It says that a two- sided limit exists if and only if both of the one-sided limits exist and are equal. 1 Theorem lim x la f s xd - L if and only if lim x la 2 f s xd - L - lim x la 1 f s xd Here we use several properties of limits (5, 1, 10, 7, 9).

SOLUTION Using the facts that | x | - x when x . 0 and | x | - 2x when x , 0, we have lim x l0 1 | x | x - lim x l0 1 x x - lim x l0 1 1 - 1 lim x l0 2 | x | x - lim x l0 2 2x x - lim x l0 2 s21d - 21 Since the right- and left-hand limits are different, it follows from Theorem 1 that lim x l 0 | x | yx does not exist. The graph of the function f s xd - | x | yx is shown in Fig- ure 4 and supports the one-sided limits that we found. ■ EXAMPLE 9 If f s xd - H s x 2 4 8 2 2x if x . 4 if x , 4 determine whether lim x l 4 f s xd exists.

Their proofs can be found in Appendix F. 2 Theorem If f s xd < ts xd when x is near a (except possibly at a) and the limits of f and t both exist as x approaches a, then lim x l a f s xd < lim x l a ts xd 3 The Squeeze Theorem If f s xd < ts xd < hs xd when x is near a (except possibly at a) and lim x l a f s xd - lim x l a hs xd - L then lim x l a ts xd - L The Squeeze Theorem, which is sometimes called the Sandwich Theorem or the Pinching Theorem, is illustrated by Figure 7. It says that if ts xd is squeezed between f s xd and hs xd near a, and if f and h have the same limit L at a, then t is forced to have the same limit L at a.

SOLUTION First note that we cannot use lim x l0 x 2 sin 1 x - lim x l0 x 2 ? lim x l0 sin 1 x because lim x l 0 sins1 yxd does not exist (see Example 2.2.4). Instead we apply the Squeeze Theorem, and so we need to ind a function f smaller than ts xd - x 2 sins1 yxd and a function h bigger than t such that both f s xd and hs xd approach 0.

","SECTION 2.4 The Precise Deinition of a Limit 105 To motivate the precise deinition of a limit, let’s consider the function f s xd - H 2x 2 1 6 if x ± 3 if x - 3 Intuitively, it is clear that when x is close to 3 but x ± 3, then f s xd is close to 5, and so lim x l3 f s xd - 5. To obtain more detailed information about how f s xd varies when x is close to 3, we ask the following question: How close to 3 does x have to be so that f s xd differs from 5 by less than 0.l? The distance from x to 3 is | x 2 3 | and the distance from f s xd to 5 is | f s xd 2 5 | , so our problem is to ind a number  such that | f s xd 2 5 | , 0.1 if | x 2 3 | ,  but x ± 3 If | x 2 3 | . 0, then x ± 3, so an equivalent formulation of our problem is to ind a number  such that | f s xd 2 5 | , 0.1 if 0 , | x 2 3 | ,  Notice that if 0 , | x 2 3 | , s0.1dy2 - 0.05, then | f s xd 2 5 | - | s2x 2 1d 2 5 | - | 2x 2 6 | - 2 | x 2 3 | , 2s0.05d - 0.1 that is, | f s xd 2 5 | , 0.1 if 0 , | x 2 3 | , 0.05 Thus an answer to the problem is given by  - 0.05; that is, if x is within a distance of 0.05 from 3, then f s xd will be within a distance of 0.1 from 5. If we change the number 0.l in our problem to the smaller number 0.01, then by using the same method we ind that f s xd will differ from 5 by less than 0.01 provided that x differs from 3 by less than (0.01)y2 - 0.005: | f s xd 2 5 | , 0.01 if 0 , | x 2 3 | , 0.005 Similarly, | f s xd 2 5 | , 0.001 if 0 , | x 2 3 | , 0.0005 The numbers 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 that we have considered are error tolerances that we might allow. For 5 to be the precise limit of f s xd as x approaches 3, we must not only be able to bring the difference between f s xd and 5 below each of these three numbers; we must be able to bring it below any positive number. And, by the same reasoning, we can! If we write « (the Greek letter epsilon) for an arbitrary positive number, then we ind as before that 1 | f s xd 2 5 | ,« if 0 , | x 2 3 | ,  - « 2 This is a precise way of saying that f s xd is close to 5 when x is close to 3 because (1) says that we can make the values of f s xd within an arbitrary distance « from 5 by restricting the values of x to be within a distance « y2 from 3 (but x ± 3). It is traditional to use the Greek letter  (delta) in this situation. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

","106 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives Note that (1) can be rewritten as follows: if 3 2  , x , 3 1  s x ± 3d then 5 2«, f s xd , 5 1« and this is illustrated in Figure 1. By taking the values of x (± 3) to lie in the interval s3 2 , 3 1 d we can make the values of f s xd lie in the interval s5 2«, 5 1«d. Using (1) as a model, we give a precise deinition of a limit. 2 Precise Deinition of a Limit Let f be a function deined on some open interval that contains the number a, except possibly at a itself. Then we say that the limit of f s xd as x approaches a is L, and we write lim x l a f s xd - L if for every number «. 0 there is a number  . 0 such that if 0 , | x 2 a | ,  then | f s xd 2 L | ,« Since | x 2 a | is the distance from x to a and | f s xd 2 L | is the distance from f s xd to L, and since « can be arbitrarily small, the deinition of a limit can be expressed in words as follows: lim x l a f s xd 5 L means that the distance between f s xd and L can be made arbitrarily small by requiring that the distance from x to a be suficiently small (but not 0). Alternatively, lim x l a f s xd 5 L means that the values of f s xd can be made as close as we please to L by requiring x to be close enough to a (but not equal to a). We can also reformulate Deinition 2 in terms of intervals by observing that the inequality | x 2 a | ,  is equivalent to 2 , x 2 a , , which in turn can be writ- ten as a 2  , x , a 1 . Also 0 , | x 2 a | is true if and only if x 2 a ± 0, that is, x ± a. Similarly, the inequality | f s xd 2 L | ,« is equivalent to the pair of inequalities L 2«, f s xd , L 1«. Therefore, in terms of intervals, Deinition 2 can be stated as follows: lim x l a f s xd 5 L means that for every «. 0 (no matter how small « is) we can ind  . 0 such that if x lies in the open interval sa 2 , a 1 d and x ± a, then f s xd lies in the open interval sL 2«, L 1«d.

","SECTION 2.4 The Precise Deinition of a Limit 107 a-∂ a ƒ a+∂ x f L-∑ L L+∑ Another geometric interpretation of limits can be given in terms of the graph of a function. If «. 0 is given, then we draw the horizontal lines y 5 L 1« and y 5 L 2« and the graph of f. (See Figure 4.) If lim x la f s xd 5 L, then we can ind a number  . 0 such that if we restrict x to lie in the interval sa 2 , a 1 d and take x ± a, then the curve y 5 f s xd lies between the lines y 5 L 2« and y 5 L 1«. (See Figure 5.) You can see that if such a  has been found, then any smaller  will also work. It is important to realize that the process illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 must work for every positive number «, no matter how small it is chosen. Figure 6 shows that if a smaller « is chosen, then a smaller  may be required. 0 x y a y=L+∑ y=L-∑ a-∂ a+∂ ∑ ∑ L when x is in here (x≠ a) ƒ is in here 0 x y a y=L+∑ y=L-∑ ∑ ∑ L y=ƒ L+∑ L-∑ 0 x y a y=L+∑ y=L-∑ a-∂ a+∂ EXAMPLE 1 Since f s xd - x 3 2 5x 1 6 is a polynomial, we know from the Direct Substitution Property that lim x l1 f s xd - f s1d - 1 3 2 5s1d 1 6 - 2. Use a graph to ind a number  such that if x is within  of 1, then y is within 0.2 of 2, that is, if | x 2 1 | ,  then | s x 3 2 5x 1 6d 2 2 | , 0.2 In other words, ind a number  that corresponds to «5 0.2 in the deinition of a limit for the function f s xd 5 x 3 2 5x 1 6 with a 5 1 and L 5 2. SOLUTION A graph of f is shown in Figure 7; we are interested in the region near the point s1, 2d. Notice that we can rewrite the inequality | s x 3 2 5x 1 6d 2 2 | , 0.2 as 20.2 , sx 3 2 5x 1 6d 2 2 , 0.2 or equivalently 1.8 , x 3 2 5x 1 6 , 2.2 So we need to determine the values of x for which the curve y 5 x 3 2 5x 1 6 lies between the horizontal lines y 5 1.8 and y 5 2.2. Therefore we graph the curves y 5 x 3 2 5x 1 6, y 5 1.8, and y 5 2.2 near the point s1, 2d in Figure 8. Then we FIGURE 4 FIGURE 5 FIGURE 6 15 _5 _3 3 FIGURE 7 y=˛-5x+6 y=2.2 y=1.8 (1, 2) 0.8 1.2 2.3 1.7 FIGURE 8 FIGURE 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","108 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives use the cursor to estimate that the x-coordinate of the point of intersection of the line y 5 2.2 and the curve y 5 x 3 2 5x 1 6 is about 0.911. Similarly, y 5 x 3 2 5x 1 6 intersects the line y 5 1.8 when x < 1.124. So, rounding toward 1 to be safe, we can say that if 0.92 , x , 1.12 then 1.8 , x 3 2 5x 1 6 , 2.2 This interval s0.92, 1.12d is not symmetric about x 5 1. The distance from x 5 1 to the left endpoint is 1 2 0.92 5 0.08 and the distance to the right endpoint is 0.12. We can choose  to be the smaller of these numbers, that is,  5 0.08. Then we can rewrite our inequalities in terms of distances as follows: if | x 2 1 | , 0.08 then | s x 3 2 5x 1 6d 2 2 | , 0.2 This just says that by keeping x within 0.08 of 1, we are able to keep f s xd within 0.2 of 2. Although we chose  5 0.08, any smaller positive value of  would also have worked. ■ The graphical procedure in Example 1 gives an illustration of the deinition for «5 0.2, but it does not prove that the limit is equal to 2. A proof has to provide a  for every «. In proving limit statements it may be helpful to think of the deinition of limit as a challenge. First it challenges you with a number «. Then you must be able to produce a suitable . You have to be able to do this for every «. 0, not just a particular «. Imagine a contest between two people, A and B, and imagine yourself to be B. Person A stipulates that the ixed number L should be approximated by the values of f s xd to within a degree of accuracy « (say , 0.01). Person B then responds by inding a number  such that if 0 , | x 2 a | , , then | f s xd 2 L | ,«. Then A may become more exacting and challenge B with a smaller value of « (say, 0.0001). Again B has to respond by inding a corresponding . Usually the smaller the value of «, the smaller the corresponding value of  must be. If B always wins, no matter how small A makes «, then lim x la f s xd 5 L. EXAMPLE 2 Prove that lim x l3 s4x 2 5d - 7. SOLUTION 1. Preliminary analysis of the problem (guessing a value for ).

But then in the second stage we had to go back and prove in a careful, logical fashion that we had made a correct guess. This procedure is typical of much of mathematics. Sometimes it is neces- sary to irst make an intelligent guess about the answer to a problem and then prove that the guess is correct. The intuitive deinitions of one-sided limits that were given in Section 2.2 can be pre- cisely reformulated as follows. 3 Deinition of Left-Hand Limit lim x la 2 f s xd - L if for every number «. 0 there is a number  . 0 such that if a 2  , x , a then | f s xd 2 L | ,« 4 Deinition of Right-Hand Limit lim x la 1 f s xd - L if for every number «. 0 there is a number  . 0 such that if a , x , a 1  then | f s xd 2 L | ,« Notice that Deinition 3 is the same as Deinition 2 except that x is restricted to lie in the left half sa 2 , ad of the interval sa 2 , a 1 d. In Deinition 4, x is restricted to lie in the right half sa, a 1 d of the interval sa 2 , a 1 d. Cauchy and Limits After the invention of calculus in the 17th century, there followed a period of free development of the subject in the 18th century. Mathematicians like the Bernoulli brothers and Euler were eager to exploit the power of calculus and boldly explored the consequences of this new and wonderful mathemati- cal theory without worrying too much about whether their proofs were com- pletely correct. The 19th century, by contrast, was the Age of Rigor in mathematics. There was a movement to go back to the founda- tions of the subject—to provide careful deinitions and rigorous proofs. At the forefront of this movement was the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857), who started out as a military engineer before becoming a mathematics professor in Paris. Cauchy took Newton’s idea of a limit, which was kept alive in the 18th century by the French mathematician Jean d’Alembert, and made it more precise. His deinition of a limit reads as follows: “When the successive values attributed to a vari- able approach indeinitely a ixed value so as to end by difering from it by as little as one wishes, this last is called the limit of all the others.” But when Cauchy used this deinition in examples and proofs, he often employed delta-epsilon inequalities similar to the ones in this section. A typical Cauchy proof starts with: “Designate by  and « two very small numbers; . . .” He used « because of the correspondence between epsi- lon and the French word erreur and  because delta corresponds to diférence. Later, the German mathematician Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897) stated the deinition of a limit exactly as in our Deinition 2. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In fact, if we had been given a more complicated function such as f s xd 5 s6x 2 2 8x 1 9dys2x 2 2 1d, a proof would require a great deal of ingenuity. Fortunately this is unnecessary because the Limit Laws stated in Section 2.3 can be proved using Deinition 2, and then the limits of complicated functions can be found rigorously from the Limit Laws without resorting to the deinition directly. For instance, we prove the Sum Law: If lim x la f s xd 5 L and lim x la ts xd 5 M both exist, then lim x l a f f s xd 1 ts xdg - L 1 M The remaining laws are proved in the exercises and in Appendix F.

The following is a precise version of Deinition 2.2.4. 6 Precise Deinition of an Ininite Limit Let f be a function deined on some open interval that contains the number a, except possibly at a itself. Then lim x l a f s xd - ` means that for every positive number M there is a positive number  such that if 0 , | x 2 a | ,  then f s xd . M This says that the values of f s xd can be made arbitrarily large (larger than any given number M) by requiring x to be close enough to a (within a distance , where  depends on M, but with x ± a). A geometric illustration is shown in Figure 10. Given any horizontal line y 5 M, we can ind a number  . 0 such that if we restrict x to lie in the interval sa 2 , a 1 d but x ± a, then the curve y 5 f s xd lies above the line y - M.

","SECTION 2.5 Continuity 115 Notice that Deinition l implicitly requires three things if f is continuous at a: 1. f sad is deined (that is, a is in the domain of f ) 2. lim x la f s xd exists 3. lim x la f s xd 5 f sad The deinition says that f is continuous at a if f s xd approaches f sad as x approaches a. Thus a continuous function f has the property that a small change in x produces only a small change in f s xd. In fact, the change in f s xd can be kept as small as we please by keeping the change in x suficiently small. If f is deined near a (in other words, f is deined on an open interval containing a, except perhaps at a), we say that f is discontinuous at a (or f has a discontinuity at a) if f is not continuous at a. Physical phenomena are usually continuous. For instance, the displacement or veloc- ity of a vehicle varies continuously with time, as does a person’s height. But disconti- nuities do occur in such situations as electric currents. [See Example 2.2.6, where the Heaviside function is discontinuous at 0 because lim t l0 Hstd does not exist.] Geometrically, you can think of a function that is continuous at every number in an interval as a function whose graph has no break in it: the graph can be drawn without removing your pen from the paper. EXAMPLE 1 Figure 2 shows the graph of a function f. At which numbers is f discon- tinuous? Why? SOLUTION It looks as if there is a discontinuity when a - 1 because the graph has a break there. The oficial reason that f is discontinuous at 1 is that f s1d is not deined. The graph also has a break when a 5 3, but the reason for the discontinuity is dif- ferent. Here, f s3d is deined, but lim x l3 f s xd does not exist (because the left and right limits are different). So f is discontinuous at 3. What about a 5 5? Here, f s5d is deined and lim x l5 f s xd exists (because the left and right limits are the same). But lim x l 5 f s xd ± f s5d So f is discontinuous at 5. ■ Now let’s see how to detect discontinuities when a function is deined by a formula. EXAMPLE 2 Where are each of the following functions discontinuous? (a) f s xd 5 x 2 2 x 2 2 x 2 2 (b) f s xd - H 1 x 2 if x ± 0 1 if x - 0 (c) f s xd - H x 2 2 x 2 2 x 2 2 if x ± 2 1 if x - 2 (d) f s xd - v x b SOLUTION (a) Notice that f s2d is not deined, so f is discontinuous at 2. Later we’ll see why f is continuous at all other numbers. FIGURE 2 y 0 x 1 2 3 4 5 As illustrated in Figure 1, if f is con- tinuous, then the points s x, f s xdd on the graph of f approach the point sa, f sadd on the graph. So there is no gap in the curve.

In each case the graph can’t be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper because a hole or break or jump occurs in the graph. The kind of discontinuity illustrated in parts (a) and (c) is called removable because we could remove the discontinuity by redeining f at just the single number 2. [The function ts xd - x 1 1 is continuous.] The discontinuity in part (b) is called an ininite discontinuity.

(If f is deined only on one side of an endpoint of the interval, we understand continuous at the endpoint to mean continuous from the right or continuous from the left.) EXAMPLE 4 Show that the function f s xd - 1 2 s1 2 x 2 is continuous on the interval f21, 1g. SOLUTION If 21 , a , 1, then using the Limit Laws, we have lim x l a f s xd - lim x l a (1 2 s1 2 x 2 ) - 1 2 lim x l a s1 2 x 2 (by Laws 2 and 7) - 1 2 s lim x l a s1 2 x 2 d (by 11) - 1 2 s1 2 a 2 (by 2, 7, and 9) - f sad Thus, by Deinition l, f is continuous at a if 21 , a , 1. Similar calculations show that lim x l21 1 f s xd - 1 - f s21d and lim x l1 2 f s xd - 1 - f s1d so f is continuous from the right at 21 and continuous from the left at 1. Therefore, according to Deinition 3, f is continuous on f21, 1g. The graph of f is sketched in Figure 4. It is the lower half of the circle x 2 1 s y 2 1d 2 - 1 ■ Instead of always using Deinitions 1, 2, and 3 to verify the continuity of a function as we did in Example 4, it is often convenient to use the next theorem, which shows how to build up complicated continuous functions from simple ones. 4 Theorem If f and t are continuous at a and c is a constant, then the following functions are also continuous at a: 1. f 1 t 2. f 2 t 3. cf 4. f t 5. f t if tsad ± 0 PROOF Each of the ive parts of this theorem follows from the corresponding Limit Law in Section 2.3. For instance, we give the proof of part 1.

The following theorem was stated in Section 2.3 as the Direct Substitution Property. 5 Theorem (a) Any polynomial is continuous everywhere; that is, it is continuous on R - s2`, `d. (b) Any rational function is continuous wherever it is deined; that is, it is contin- uous on its domain. PROOF (a) A polynomial is a function of the form Ps xd - c n x n 1 c n21 x n21 1 ∙∙∙ 1 c 1 x 1 c 0 where c 0 , c 1 , . . . , c n are constants. We know that lim x la c 0 - c 0 (by Law 7) and lim x la x m - a m m - 1, 2, . . . , n (by 9) This equation is precisely the statement that the function f s xd - x m is a continuous function. Thus, by part 3 of Theorem 4, the function ts xd - cx m is continuous. Since P is a sum of functions of this form and a constant function, it follows from part 1 of Theorem 4 that P is continuous. (b) A rational function is a function of the form f s xd - Ps xd Qs xd where P and Q are polynomials. The domain of f is D - h x [ R | Qs xd ± 0j. We know from part (a) that P and Q are continuous everywhere. Thus, by part 5 of Theo- rem 4, f is continuous at every number in D. ■ As an illustration of Theorem 5, observe that the volume of a sphere varies con- tinuously with its radius because the formula Vsrd - 4 3 r 3 shows that V is a polyno- mial function of r. Likewise, if a ball is thrown vertically into the air with a velocity of 50 ftys, then the height of the ball in feet t seconds later is given by the formula h - 50t 2 16t 2 . Again this is a polynomial function, so the height is a continuous func- tion of the elapsed time, as we might expect. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 2.5 Continuity 119 Knowledge of which functions are continuous enables us to evaluate some limits very quickly, as the following example shows. Compare it with Example 2.3.2(b). EXAMPLE 5 Find lim x l22 x 3 1 2 x 2 2 1 5 2 3x . SOLUTION The function f s xd - x 3 1 2x 2 2 1 5 2 3x is rational, so by Theorem 5 it is continuous on its domain, which is h x | x ± 5 3 j. Therefore lim x l22 x 3 1 2 x 2 2 1 5 2 3x - lim x l22 f s xd - f s22d - s22d 3 1 2s22d 2 2 1 5 2 3s22d - 2 1 11 ■ It turns out that most of the familiar functions are continuous at every number in their domains. For instance, Limit Law 10 (page 96) is exactly the statement that root func- tions are continuous. From the appearance of the graphs of the sine and cosine functions (Figure 1.2.18), we would certainly guess that they are continuous. We know from the deinitions of sin  and cos  that the coordinates of the point P in Figure 5 are scos , sin d. As  l 0, we see that P approaches the point s1, 0d and so cos  l 1 and sin  l 0. Thus 6 lim  l 0 cos  - 1 lim  l 0 sin  - 0 Since cos 0 - 1 and sin 0 - 0, the equations in (6) assert that the cosine and sine func- tions are continuous at 0. The addition formulas for cosine and sine can then be used to deduce that these functions are continuous everywhere (see Exercises 64 and 65). It follows from part 5 of Theorem 4 that tan x - sin x cos x is continuous except where cos x - 0. This happens when x is an odd integer multiple of y2, so y - tan x has ininite discontinuities when x - 6y2, 63y2, 65y2, and so on (see Figure 6). _ _ x y π 0 _π 1 π 2 3π 2 π 2 3π 2 ¨ 1 x 0 y (1, 0) P(cos ¨, sin ¨) FIGURE 5 Another way to establish the limits in (6) is to use the Squeeze Theorem with the inequality sin  ,  (for  . 0), which is proved in Section 3.3.

","120 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives The inverse function of any continuous one-to-one function is also continuous. (This fact is proved in Appendix F, but our geometric intuition makes it seem plausible: The graph of f 21 is obtained by relecting the graph of f about the line y - x. So if the graph of f has no break in it, neither does the graph of f 21 .) Thus the inverse trigonometric functions are continuous. In Section 1.4 we deined the exponential function y - b x so as to ill in the holes in the graph of y - b x where x is rational. In other words, the very deinition of y - b x makes it a continuous function on R. Therefore its inverse function y - log b x is con- tinuous on s0, `d. 7 Theorem The following types of functions are continuous at every number in their domains: • polynomials • rational functions • root functions • trigonometric functions • inverse trigonometric functions • exponential functions • logarithmic functions The inverse trigonometric functions are reviewed in Section 1.5. EXAMPLE 6 Where is the function f s xd - ln x 1 tan 21 x x 2 2 1 continuous? SOLUTION We know from Theorem 7 that the function y - ln x is continuous for x . 0 and y - tan 21 x is continuous on R. Thus, by part 1 of Theorem 4, y - ln x 1 tan 21 x is continuous on s0, `d. The denominator, y - x 2 2 1, is a polynomial, so it is continuous everywhere. Therefore, by part 5 of Theorem 4, f is continuous at all positive numbers x except where x 2 2 1 - 0 &? x - 61. So f is continuous on the intervals s0, 1d and s1, `d. ■ EXAMPLE 7 Evaluate lim x l sin x 2 1 cos x . SOLUTION Theorem 7 tells us that y - sin x is continuous. The function in the denominator, y - 2 1 cos x, is the sum of two continuous functions and is therefore continuous. Notice that this function is never 0 because cos x >21 for all x and so 2 1 cos x . 0 everywhere. Thus the ratio f sxd - sin x 2 1 cos x is continuous everywhere. Hence, by the deinition of a continuous function, lim x l sin x 2 1 cos x - lim x l f sxd - f sd - sin  2 1 cos  - 0 2 2 1 - 0 ■ Another way of combining continuous functions f and t to get a new continuous function is to form the composite function f 8 t. This fact is a consequence of the fol- lowing theorem. 8 Theorem If f is continuous at b and lim x la ts xd - b, then lim x la f s ts xdd - f sbd. In other words, lim x la f s t s xdd - f S lim x l a ts xd D This theorem says that a limit symbol can be moved through a function sym- bol if the function is continuous and the limit exists. In other words, the order of these two symbols can be reversed. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

","SECTION 2.5 Continuity 121 Intuitively, Theorem 8 is reasonable because if x is close to a, then ts xd is close to b, and since f is continuous at b, if ts xd is close to b, then f s ts xdd is close to f sbd. A proof of Theorem 8 is given in Appendix F. EXAMPLE 8 Evaluate lim x l1 arcsin S 1 2 sx 1 2 x D .

This theorem is often expressed informally by saying “a continuous function of a continuous function is a continuous function.” PROOF Since t is continuous at a, we have lim x l a ts xd - tsad Since f is continuous at b - tsad, we can apply Theorem 8 to obtain lim x la f s t s xdd - f s t sadd Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","122 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives which is precisely the statement that the function hs xd - f s t s xdd is continuous at a; that is, f 8 t is continuous at a. ■ EXAMPLE 9 Where are the following functions continuous? (a) hs xd - sins x 2 d (b) Fs xd - lns1 1 cos xd SOLUTION (a) We have hs xd - f s t s xdd, where ts xd - x 2 and f s xd - sin x Now t is continuous on R since it is a polynomial, and f is also continuous everywhere. Thus h - f 8 t is continuous on R by Theorem 9. (b) We know from Theorem 7 that f s xd - ln x is continuous and ts xd - 1 1 cos x is continuous (because both y - 1 and y - cos x are continuous). Therefore, by Theo- rem 9, Fs xd - f s t s xdd is continuous wherever it is deined. Now ln s1 1 cos xd is deined when 1 1 cos x . 0. So it is undeined when cos x - 21, and this happens when x - 6, 63, . . . . Thus F has discontinuities when x is an odd multiple of  and is continuous on the intervals between these values (see Figure 7). ■ An important property of continuous functions is expressed by the following theorem, whose proof is found in more advanced books on calculus. 10 The Intermediate Value Theorem Suppose that f is continuous on the closed interval fa, bg and let N be any number between f sad and f sbd, where f sad ± f sbd. Then there exists a number c in sa, bd such that f scd - N. The Intermediate Value Theorem states that a continuous function takes on every intermediate value between the function values f sad and f sbd. It is illustrated by Figure 8. Note that the value N can be taken on once [as in part (a)] or more than once [as in part (b)]. (b) 0 x y f(b) N f(a) a c£ b y=ƒ c™ c¡ (a) 0 x y f(b) N f(a) b y=ƒ a c FIGURE 8 If we think of a continuous function as a function whose graph has no hole or break, then it is easy to believe that the Intermediate Value Theorem is true. In geometric terms it says that if any horizontal line y - N is given between y - f sad and y - f sbd as in Fig- ure 9, then the graph of f can’t jump over the line. It must intersect y - N somewhere. It is important that the function f in Theorem 10 be continuous. The Intermediate Value Theorem is not true in general for discontinuous functions (see Exercise 50). 2 _6 _10 10 FIGURE 7 y - lns1 1 cos xd b 0 x y f(a) N f(b) a y=N y=ƒ FIGURE 9 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 2.5 Continuity 123 One use of the Intermediate Value Theorem is in locating roots of equations as in the following example. EXAMPLE 10 Show that there is a root of the equation 4x 3 2 6x 2 1 3x 2 2 - 0 between 1 and 2. SOLUTION Let f s xd - 4x 3 2 6x 2 1 3x 2 2. We are looking for a solution of the given equation, that is, a number c between 1 and 2 such that f scd - 0. Therefore we take a - 1, b - 2, and N - 0 in Theorem 10. We have f s1d - 4 2 6 1 3 2 2 - 21 , 0 and f s2d - 32 2 24 1 6 2 2 - 12 . 0 Thus f s1d , 0 , f s2d; that is, N - 0 is a number between f s1d and f s2d. Now f is continuous since it is a polynomial, so the Intermediate Value Theorem says there is a number c between 1 and 2 such that f scd - 0. In other words, the equation 4x 3 2 6x 2 1 3x 2 2 - 0 has at least one root c in the interval s1, 2d. In fact, we can locate a root more precisely by using the Intermediate Value Theorem again. Since f s1.2d - 20.128 , 0 and f s1.3d - 0.548 . 0 a root must lie between 1.2 and 1.3. A calculator gives, by trial and error, f s1.22d - 20.007008 , 0 and f s1.23d - 0.056068 . 0 so a root lies in the interval s1.22, 1.23d. ■ We can use a graphing calculator or computer to illustrate the use of the Intermediate Value Theorem in Example 10. Figure 10 shows the graph of f in the viewing rectangle f21, 3g by f23, 3g and you can see that the graph crosses the x-axis between 1 and 2. Fig- ure 11 shows the result of zooming in to the viewing rectangle f1.2, 1.3g by f20.2, 0.2g. 0.2 _0 .2 1.2 1.3 3 _3 _1 3 FIGURE 10 FIGURE 11 In fact, the Intermediate Value Theorem plays a role in the very way these graphing devices work. A computer calculates a inite number of points on the graph and turns on the pixels that contain these calculated points. It assumes that the function is continuous and takes on all the intermediate values between two consecutive points. The computer therefore “connects the dots” by turning on the intermediate pixels.

A Tibetan monk leaves the monastery at 7:00 am and takes his usual path to the top of the mountain, arriving at 7:00 pm. The following morning, he starts at 7:00 am at the top and takes the same path back, arriving at the monastery at 7:00 pm. Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to show that there is a point on the path that the monk will cross at exactly the same time of day on both days. In Sections 2.2 and 2.4 we investigated ininite limits and vertical asymptotes. There we let x approach a number and the result was that the values of y became arbitrarily large (positive or negative). In this section we let x become arbitrarily large (positive or nega- tive) and see what happens to y. Let’s begin by investigating the behavior of the function f deined by f s xd - x 2 2 1 x 2 1 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 2.6 Limits at Ininity; Horizontal Asymptotes 127 as x becomes large. The table at the left gives values of this function correct to six decimal places, and the graph of f has been drawn by a computer in Figure 1. x 1 0 y y=1 y= ≈-1 ≈+1 FIGURE 1 As x grows larger and larger you can see that the values of f s xd get closer and closer to 1. (The graph of f approaches the horizontal line y - 1 as we look to the right.) In fact, it seems that we can make the values of f s xd as close as we like to 1 by taking x suficiently large. This situation is expressed symbolically by writing lim x l ` x 2 2 1 x 2 1 1 - 1 In general, we use the notation lim x l ` f s xd - L to indicate that the values of f s xd approach L as x becomes larger and larger. 1 Intuitive Deinition of a Limit at Ininity Let f be a function deined on some interval sa, `d. Then lim x l ` f s xd - L means that the values of f s xd can be made arbitrarily close to L by requiring x to be suficiently large. Another notation for lim x l ` f s xd - L is f s xd l L as x l ` The symbol ` does not represent a number. Nonetheless, the expression lim x l` f s xd - L is often read as “the limit of f s xd, as x approaches ininity, is L” or “the limit of f s xd, as x becomes ininite, is L” or “the limit of f s xd, as x increases without bound, is L” The meaning of such phrases is given by Deinition 1. A more precise deinition, similar to the «,  deinition of Section 2.4, is given at the end of this section. Geometric illustrations of Deinition 1 are shown in Figure 2. Notice that there are many ways for the graph of f to approach the line y - L (which is called a horizontal asymptote) as we look to the far right of each graph. Referring back to Figure 1, we see that for numerically large negative values of x, the values of f s xd are close to 1. By letting x decrease through negative values without bound, we can make f s xd as close to 1 as we like. This is expressed by writing lim x l2` x 2 2 1 x 2 1 1 - 1 x y 0 y=ƒ y=L 0 x y y=ƒ y=L x y 0 y=ƒ y=L FIGURE 2 Examples illustrating lim x l` f s xd - L x f s xd 0 21 61 0 62 0.600000 63 0.800000 64 0.882353 65 0.923077 610 0.980198 650 0.999200 6100 0.999800 61000 0.999998 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","128 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives The general deinition is as follows. 2 Deinition Let f be a function deined on some interval s2`, ad. Then lim x l 2` f s xd - L means that the values of f s xd can be made arbitrarily close to L by requiring x to be suficiently large negative. Again, the symbol 2` does not represent a number, but the expression lim x l2` f s xd - L is often read as “ the limit of f s xd, as x approaches negative ininity, is L” Deinition 2 is illustrated in Figure 3. Notice that the graph approaches the line y - L as we look to the far left of each graph. 3 Deinition The line y - L is called a horizontal asymptote of the curve y - f s xd if either lim x l` f s xd - L or lim x l2` f s xd - L For instance, the curve illustrated in Figure 1 has the line y - 1 as a horizontal asymp- tote because lim x l ` x 2 2 1 x 2 1 1 - 1 An example of a curve with two horizontal asymptotes is y - tan 21 x. (See Figure 4.) In fact, lim x l2` tan 21 x - 2  2 lim x l ` tan 21 x -  2 so both of the lines y - 2y2 and y - y2 are horizontal asymptotes. (This follows from the fact that the lines x - 6y2 are vertical asymptotes of the graph of the tangent function.) EXAMPLE 1 Find the ininite limits, limits at ininity, and asymptotes for the function f whose graph is shown in Figure 5. SOLUTION We see that the values of f s xd become large as x l 21 from both sides, so lim x l21 f s xd - ` Notice that f s xd becomes large negative as x approaches 2 from the left, but large posi- tive as x approaches 2 from the right. So lim x l2 2 f s xd - 2` and lim x l2 1 f s xd - ` Thus both of the lines x - 21 and x - 2 are vertical asymptotes.

","SECTION 2.6 Limits at Ininity; Horizontal Asymptotes 129 As x becomes large, it appears that f s xd approaches 4. But as x decreases through negative values, f s xd approaches 2. So lim x l ` f s xd - 4 and lim x l2` f s xd - 2 This means that both y - 4 and y - 2 are horizontal asymptotes. ■ EXAMPLE 2 Find lim x l ` 1 x and lim x l2` 1 x . SOLUTION Observe that when x is large, 1 yx is small. For instance, 1 100 - 0.01 1 10,000 - 0.0001 1 1,000,000 - 0.000001 In fact, by taking x large enough, we can make 1 yx as close to 0 as we please. There- fore, according to Deinition 1, we have lim x l ` 1 x - 0 Similar reasoning shows that when x is large negative, 1 yx is small negative, so we also have lim x l2` 1 x - 0 It follows that the line y - 0 (the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote of the curve y - 1 yx. (This is an equilateral hyperbola; see Figure 6.) ■ Most of the Limit Laws that were given in Section 2.3 also hold for limits at ininity. It can be proved that the Limit Laws listed in Section 2.3 (with the exception of Laws 9 and 10) are also valid if “x l a” is replaced by “x l `” or “x l 2`.” In particular, if we combine Laws 6 and 11 with the results of Example 2, we obtain the following important rule for calculating limits. 5 Theorem If r . 0 is a rational number, then lim x l ` 1 x r - 0 If r . 0 is a rational number such that x r is deined for all x, then lim x l2` 1 x r - 0 EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate lim x l` 3x 2 2 x 2 2 5x 2 1 4x 1 1 and indicate which properties of limits are used at each stage.

","130 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives To evaluate the limit at ininity of any rational function, we irst divide both the numerator and denominator by the highest power of x that occurs in the denominator. (We may assume that x ± 0, since we are interested only in large values of x.) In this case the highest power of x in the denominator is x 2 , so we have lim x l` 3x 2 2 x 2 2 5x 2 1 4x 1 1 - lim x l` 3x 2 2 x 2 2 x 2 5x 2 1 4x 1 1 x 2 - lim x l` 3 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 5 1 4 x 1 1 x 2 - lim x l` S 3 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 D lim x l` S 5 1 4 x 1 1 x 2 D (by Limit Law 5) - lim x l` 3 2 lim x l` 1 x 2 2 lim x l` 1 x 2 lim x l` 5 1 4 lim x l` 1 x 1 lim x l` 1 x 2 (by 1, 2, and 3) - 3 2 0 2 0 5 1 0 1 0 (by 7 and Theorem 5) - 3 5 A similar calculation shows that the limit as x l 2` is also 3 5 . Figure 7 illustrates the results of these calculations by showing how the graph of the given rational function approaches the horizontal asymptote y - 3 5 - 0.6. ■ EXAMPLE 4 Find the horizontal and vertical asymptotes of the graph of the function f s xd - s2x 2 1 1 3x 2 5 SOLUTION Dividing both numerator and denominator by x and using the properties of limits, we have lim x l ` s2x 2 1 1 3x 2 5 - lim x l ` s2 x 2 1 1 x 3x 2 5 x - lim x l ` Î 2x 2 1 1 x 2 3x 2 5 x (since sx 2 - x for x . 0) - lim x l` Î 2 1 1 x 2 lim x l` S 3 2 5 x D - Î lim x l` 2 1 lim x l` 1 x 2 lim x l` 3 2 5 lim x l` 1 x - s 2 1 0 3 2 5 ? 0 - s 2 3 Therefore the line y - s 2 y3 is a horizontal asymptote of the graph of f. 1 y=0.6 x y 0 FIGURE 7 y - 3x 2 2 x 2 2 5x 2 1 4x 1 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 2.6 Limits at Ininity; Horizontal Asymptotes 131 In computing the limit as x l 2`, we must remember that for x , 0, we have sx 2 - | x | - 2x. So when we divide the numerator by x, for x , 0 we get s2x 2 1 1 x - s2x 2 1 1 2 sx 2 - 2 Î 2x 2 1 1 x 2 - 2 Î 2 1 1 x 2 Therefore lim x l2` s2x 2 1 1 3x 2 5 - lim x l2` 2Î 2 1 1 x 2 3 2 5 x - 2Î 2 1 lim x l2` 1 x 2 3 2 5 lim x l2` 1 x - 2 s 2 3 Thus the line y - 2s 2 y3 is also a horizontal asymptote. A vertical asymptote is likely to occur when the denominator, 3x 2 5, is 0, that is, when x - 5 3 . If x is close to 5 3 and x . 5 3 , then the denominator is close to 0 and 3x 2 5 is positive. The numerator s2x 2 1 1 is always positive, so f s xd is positive. Therefore lim x l s5y3d 1 s2x 2 1 1 3x 2 5 - ` (Notice that the numerator does not approach 0 as x l 5y3 ). If x is close to 5 3 but x , 5 3 , then 3x 2 5 , 0 and so f s xd is large negative. Thus lim x ls5y3d 2 s2x 2 1 1 3x 2 5 - 2` The vertical asymptote is x - 5 3 . All three asymptotes are shown in Figure 8. ■ EXAMPLE 5 Compute lim x l` (sx 2 1 1 2 x). SOLUTION Because both sx 2 1 1 and x are large when x is large, it’s dificult to see what happens to their difference, so we use algebra to rewrite the function. We irst multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate radical: lim x l` (sx 2 1 1 2 x) - lim x l` (sx 2 1 1 2 x) ? sx 2 1 1 1 x sx 2 1 1 1 x - lim x l` s x 2 1 1d 2 x 2 sx 2 1 1 1 x - lim x l` 1 sx 2 1 1 1 x Notice that the denominator of this last expression (sx 2 1 1 1 x) becomes large as x l ` (it’s bigger than x). So lim x l` (sx 2 1 1 2 x) - lim x l` 1 sx 2 1 1 1 x - 0 Figure 9 illustrates this result. ■ x y y= oe„ 2 3 y=_ oe„ 2 3 x= 5 3 FIGURE 8 y - s2 x 2 1 1 3x 2 5 We can think of the given function as having a denominator of 1.

Therefore, by the second equation in (4), we have lim x l2 1 arctan S 1 x 2 2 D - lim t l` arctan t -  2 ■ The graph of the natural exponential function y - e x has the line y - 0 (the x-axis) as a horizontal asymptote. (The same is true of any exponential function with base b . 1.)

SOLUTION As x increases, the values of sin x oscillate between 1 and 21 ininitely often and so they don’t approach any deinite number.

Therefore we can write lim x l ` x 3 - ` Similarly, when x is large negative, so is x 3 . Thus lim x l2` x 3 - 2` These limit statements can also be seen from the graph of y - x 3 in Figure 11. ■ Looking at Figure 10 we see that lim x l` e x - ` but, as Figure 12 demonstrates, y - e x becomes large as x l ` at a much faster rate than y - x 3 . EXAMPLE 10 Find lim x l` s x 2 2 xd. SOLUTION It would be wrong to write lim x l` s x 2 2 xd - lim x l` x 2 2 lim x l` x - `2` The Limit Laws can’t be applied to ininite limits because ` is not a number (`2` can’t be deined). However, we can write lim x l` s x 2 2 xd - lim x l` x s x 2 1d - ` because both x and x 2 1 become arbitrarily large and so their product does too. ■ EXAMPLE 11 Find lim x l ` x 2 1 x 3 2 x .

","134 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives The next example shows that by using ininite limits at ininity, together with inter- cepts, we can get a rough idea of the graph of a polynomial without having to plot a large number of points. EXAMPLE 12 Sketch the graph of y - s x 2 2d 4 s x 1 1d 3 s x 2 1d by inding its inter- cepts and its limits as x l ` and as x l 2`. SOLUTION The y-intercept is f s0d - s22d 4 s1d 3 s21d - 216 and the x-intercepts are found by setting y - 0: x - 2, 21, 1. Notice that since s x 2 2d 4 is never negative, the function doesn’t change sign at 2; thus the graph doesn’t cross the x-axis at 2. The graph crosses the axis at 21 and 1.

","142 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives There is another expression for the slope of a tangent line that is sometimes easier to use. If h - x 2 a, then x - a 1 h and so the slope of the secant line PQ is m PQ - f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h (See Figure 3 where the case h . 0 is illustrated and Q is to the right of P. If it happened that h , 0, however, Q would be to the left of P.) Notice that as x approaches a, h approaches 0 (because h - x 2 a) and so the expres- sion for the slope of the tangent line in Deinition 1 becomes m - lim h l 0 f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h EXAMPLE 2 Find an equation of the tangent line to the hyperbola y - 3 yx at the point s3, 1d.

In general, suppose an object moves along a straight line according to an equation of motion s - f std, where s is the displacement (directed distance) of the object from the origin at time t. The function f that describes the motion is called the position func- tion of the object. In the time interval from t - a to t - a 1 h the change in position is f sa 1 hd 2 f sad.

","SECTION 2.7 Derivatives and Rates of Change 143 The average velocity over this time interval is average velocity - displacement time - f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h which is the same as the slope of the secant line PQ in Figure 6. Now suppose we compute the average velocities over shorter and shorter time inter- vals fa, a 1 hg. In other words, we let h approach 0. As in the example of the falling ball, we deine the velocity (or instantaneous velocity) vsad at time t - a to be the limit of these average velocities: vsad - lim h l 0 f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h This means that the velocity at time t - a is equal to the slope of the tangent line at P (compare Equations 2 and 3). Now that we know how to compute limits, let’s reconsider the problem of the fall- ing ball. EXAMPLE 3 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the CN Tower, 450 m above the ground. (a) What is the velocity of the ball after 5 seconds? (b) How fast is the ball traveling when it hits the ground? SOLUTION We will need to ind the velocity both when t - 5 and when the ball hits the ground, so it’s eficient to start by inding the velocity at a general time t. Using the equation of motion s - f std - 4.9t 2 , we have v std - lim h l0 f st 1 hd 2 f std h - lim h l0 4.9st 1 hd 2 2 4.9t 2 h - lim h l0 4.9st 2 1 2th 1 h 2 2 t 2 d h - lim h l0 4.9s2th 1 h 2 d h - lim h l0 4.9hs2t 1 hd h - lim h l0 4.9s2t 1 hd - 9.8t (a) The velocity after 5 seconds is vs5d - s9.8ds5d - 49 mys. (b) Since the observation deck is 450 m above the ground, the ball will hit the ground at the time t when sstd - 450, that is, 4.9t 2 - 450 This gives t 2 - 450 4.9 and t - Î 450 4.9 < 9.6 s 0 P { a, f(a)} Q{a+h, f(a+h)} h a+h a s t m PQ = = average velocity f(a+h)-f(a) h FIGURE 6 3 Recall from Section 2.1: The distance (in meters) fallen after t seconds is 4.9t 2 .

In fact, limits of the form lim h l0 f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h arise whenever we calculate a rate of change in any of the sciences or engineering, such as a rate of reaction in chemistry or a marginal cost in economics. Since this type of limit occurs so widely, it is given a special name and notation. 4 Deinition The derivative of a function f at a number a, denoted by f 9 sad, is f 9 sad - lim h l0 f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h if this limit exists. If we write x - a 1 h, then we have h - x 2 a and h approaches 0 if and only if x approaches a. Therefore an equivalent way of stating the deinition of the derivative, as we saw in inding tangent lines, is f 9 sad - lim x l a f s xd 2 f sad x 2 a EXAMPLE 4 Find the derivative of the function f s xd - x 2 2 8x 1 9 at the number a. SOLUTION From Deinition 4 we have f 9 sad - lim h l0 f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h - lim h l0 fsa 1 hd 2 2 8sa 1 hd 1 9g 2 fa 2 2 8a 1 9g h - lim h l0 a 2 1 2ah 1 h 2 2 8a 2 8h 1 9 2 a 2 1 8a 2 9 h - lim h l0 2ah 1 h 2 2 8h h - lim h l0 s2a 1 h 2 8d - 2a 2 8 ■ f 9 sad is read “ f prime of a.” 5 Deinitions 4 and 5 are equivalent, so we can use either one to compute the derivative. In practice, Deinition 4 often leads to simpler computations. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

","SECTION 2.7 Derivatives and Rates of Change 145 We deined the tangent line to the curve y - f s xd at the point Psa, f sadd to be the line that passes through P and has slope m given by Equation 1 or 2. Since, by Deini tion 4, this is the same as the derivative f 9 sad, we can now say the following. The tangent line to y - f s xd at sa, f sadd is the line through sa, f sadd whose slope is equal to f 9 sad, the derivative of f at a. If we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can write an equation of the tangent line to the curve y - f s xd at the point sa, f sadd: y 2 f sad - f 9 sads x 2 ad EXAMPLE 5 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola y - x 2 2 8x 1 9 at the point s3, 26d. SOLUTION From Example 4 we know that the derivative of f s xd - x 2 2 8x 1 9 at the number a is f 9 sad - 2a 2 8. Therefore the slope of the tangent line at s3, 26d is f 9 s3d - 2s3d 2 8 - 22. Thus an equation of the tangent line, shown in Figure 7, is y 2 s26d - s22ds x 2 3d or y - 22x ■ Rates of Change Suppose y is a quantity that depends on another quantity x. Thus y is a function of x and we write y - f s xd. If x changes from x 1 to x 2 , then the change in x (also called the incre- ment of x) is Dx - x 2 2 x 1 and the corresponding change in y is Dy - f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d The difference quotient Dy Dx - f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d x 2 2 x 1 is called the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval fx 1 , x 2 g and can be interpreted as the slope of the secant line PQ in Figure 8. By analogy with velocity, we consider the average rate of change over smaller and smaller intervals by letting x 2 approach x 1 and therefore letting Dx approach 0. The limit of these average rates of change is called the (instantaneous) rate of change of y with respect to x at x - x 1 , which (as in the case of velocity) is interpreted as the slope of the tangent to the curve y - f s xd at Ps x 1 , f s x 1 dd: 6 instantaneous rate of change - lim Dx l 0 Dy D x - lim x2 l x 1 f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d x 2 2 x 1 We recognize this limit as being the derivative f 9 s x 1 d. y=≈-8x+9 (3, _6) y=_2 x 0 x y FIGURE 7 average rate of change - mPQ instantaneous rate of change - slope of tangent at P FIGURE 8 0 x y ⁄ ¤ Q{ ¤, ‡} Îx Îy P {⁄, ﬂ} Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","146 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives We know that one interpretation of the derivative f 9sad is as the slope of the tangent line to the curve y - f s xd when x - a. We now have a second interpretation: The derivative f 9 sad is the instantaneous rate of change of y - f s xd with respect to x when x - a. The connection with the irst interpretation is that if we sketch the curve y - f s xd, then the instantaneous rate of change is the slope of the tangent to this curve at the point where x - a. This means that when the derivative is large (and therefore the curve is steep, as at the point P in Figure 9), the y-values change rapidly. When the derivative is small, the curve is relatively lat (as at point Q) and the y-values change slowly. In particular, if s - f std is the position function of a particle that moves along a straight line, then f 9 sad is the rate of change of the displacement s with respect to the time t. In other words, f 9 sad is the velocity of the particle at time t - a. The speed of the particle is the absolute value of the velocity, that is, | f 9 sad | . In the next example we discuss the meaning of the derivative of a function that is deined verbally. EXAMPLE 6 A manufacturer produces bolts of a fabric with a ixed width. The cost of producing x yards of this fabric is C - f s xd dollars. (a) What is the meaning of the derivative f 9 s xd? What are its units? (b) In practical terms, what does it mean to say that f 9 s1000d - 9? (c) Which do you think is greater, f 9 s50d or f 9 s500d? What about f 9 s5000d? SOLUTION (a) The derivative f 9 s xd is the instantaneous rate of change of C with respect to x ; that is, f 9 s xd means the rate of change of the production cost with respect to the number of yards produced. (Economists call this rate of change the marginal cost. This idea is discussed in more detail in Sections 3.7 and 4.7.) Because f 9 s xd - lim Dx l 0 DC Dx the units for f 9 s xd are the same as the units for the difference quotient DC yDx. Since DC is measured in dollars and Dx in yards, it follows that the units for f 9 s xd are dollars per yard. (b) The statement that f 9 s1000d - 9 means that, after 1000 yards of fabric have been manufactured, the rate at which the production cost is increasing is $9yyard. (When x - 1000, C is increasing 9 times as fast as x.) Since Dx - 1 is small compared with x - 1000, we could use the approximation f 9 s1000d< DC Dx - DC 1 - DC and say that the cost of manufacturing the 1000th yard (or the 1001st) is about $9. (c) The rate at which the production cost is increasing (per yard) is probably lower when x - 500 than when x - 50 (the cost of making the 500th yard is less than the cost of the 50th yard) because of economies of scale. (The manufacturer makes more FIGURE 9 The y-values are changing rapidly at P and slowly at Q. P Q x y Here we are assuming that the cost function is well behaved; in other words, Csxd doesn’t oscillate rapidly near x - 1000. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

So f 9 s50d . f 9 s500d But, as production expands, the resulting large-scale operation might become inefi- cient and there might be overtime costs. Thus it is possible that the rate of increase of costs will eventually start to rise. So it may happen that f 9 s5000d . f 9 s500d ■ In the following example we estimate the rate of change of the national debt with respect to time. Here the function is deined not by a formula but by a table of values. EXAMPLE 7 Let Dstd be the US national debt at time t. The table in the margin gives approximate values of this function by providing end of year estimates, in billions of dollars, from 1985 to 2010. Interpret and estimate the value of D9 s2000d. SOLUTION The derivative D9 s2000d means the rate of change of D with respect to t when t - 2000, that is, the rate of increase of the national debt in 2000. According to Equation 5, D9 s2000d - lim t l 2000 Dstd 2 Ds2000d t 2 2000 So we compute and tabulate values of the difference quotient (the average rates of change) as follows. t Time interval Average rate of change - Dstd 2 Ds2000d t 2 2000 1985 [1985, 2000] 247.75 1990 [1990, 2000] 229.74 1995 [1995, 2000] 134.70 2005 [2000, 2005] 501.64 2010 [2000, 2010] 836.30 From this table we see that D9 s2000d lies somewhere between 134.70 and 501.64 billion dollars per year. [Here we are making the reasonable assumption that the debt didn’t luctuate wildly between 1995 and 2005.] We estimate that the rate of increase of the national debt of the United States in 2000 was the average of these two numbers, namely D9 s2000d< 318 billion dollars per year Another method would be to plot the debt function and estimate the slope of the tangent line when t - 2000. ■ In Examples 3, 6, and 7 we saw three speciic examples of rates of change: the veloc- ity of an object is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time; marginal cost is the rate of change of production cost with respect to the number of items produced; the rate of change of the debt with respect to time is of interest in economics. Here is a small sample of other rates of change: In physics, the rate of change of work with respect to time is called power. Chemists who study a chemical reaction are interested in the rate of change in the concentration of a reactant with respect to time (called the rate of reaction). t Dstd 1985 1945.9 1990 3364.8 1995 4988.7 2000 5662.2 2005 8170.4 2010 14,025.2 Source: US Dept. of the Treasury A Note On Units The units for the average rate of change D DyDt are the units for D D divided by the units for Dt, namely billions of dol- lars per year. The instantaneous rate of change is the limit of the average rates of change, so it is measured in the same units: billions of dollars per year. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In fact, the computation of rates of change is important in all of the natural sciences, in engineering, and even in the social sciences. Further examples will be given in Section 3.7. All these rates of change are derivatives and can therefore be interpreted as slopes of tangents. This gives added signiicance to the solution of the tangent problem. Whenever we solve a problem involving tangent lines, we are not just solving a problem in geom- etry. We are also implicitly solving a great variety of problems involving rates of change in science and engineering. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","152 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives WRITING PROJECT EARLY METHODS FOR FINDING TANGENTS The irst person to formulate explicitly the ideas of limits and derivatives was Sir Isaac Newton in the 1660s. But Newton acknowledged that “If I have seen further than other men, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.” Two of those giants were Pierre Fermat (1601–1665) and Newton’s mentor at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow (1630–1677). Newton was familiar with the methods that these men used to ind tangent lines, and their methods played a role in Newton’s eventual formulation of calculus. The following references contain explanations of these methods. Read one or more of the references and write a report comparing the methods of either Fermat or Barrow to modern methods. In particular, use the method of Section 2.7 to ind an equation of the tangent line to the curve y - x 3 1 2x at the point (1, 3) and show how either Fermat or Barrow would have solved the same problem. Although you used derivatives and they did not, point out similari- ties between the methods. 1. Carl Boyer and Uta Merzbach, A History of Mathematics (New York: Wiley, 1989), pp. 389, 432. 2. C. H.

In the preceding section we considered the derivative of a function f at a ixed number a: f 9 sad - lim h l 0 f sa 1 hd 2 f sad h Here we change our point of view and let the number a vary. If we replace a in Equa- tion 1 by a variable x, we obtain f 9 s xd - lim h l 0 f s x 1 hd 2 f s xd h Given any number x for which this limit exists, we assign to x the number f 9 s xd. So we can regard f 9 as a new function, called the derivative of f and deined by Equation 2. We know that the value of f 9 at x, f 9 s xd, can be interpreted geometrically as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at the point s x, f s xdd. 1 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 2.8 The Derivative as a Function 153 The function f 9 is called the derivative of f because it has been “derived” from f by the limiting operation in Equation 2. The domain of f 9 is the set h x | f 9 s xd existsj and may be smaller than the domain of f. EXAMPLE 1 The graph of a function f is given in Figure 1. Use it to sketch the graph of the derivative f 9 . SOLUTION We can estimate the value of the derivative at any value of x by drawing the tangent at the point s x, f s xdd and estimating its slope. For instance, for x - 5 we draw the tangent at P in Figure 2(a) and estimate its slope to be about 3 2 , so f 9 s5d< 1.5. This allows us to plot the point P9 s5, 1.5d on the graph of f 9 directly beneath P . (The slope of the graph of f becomes the y-value on the graph of f 9.) Repeating this procedure at several points, we get the graph shown in Figure 2(b). Notice that the tangents at A, B, and C are horizontal, so the derivative is 0 there and the graph of f 9 crosses the x-axis (where y - 0) at the points A 9, B9, and C9, directly beneath A, B, and C. Between A and B the tangents have positive slope, so f 9 s xd is positive there. (The graph is above the x-axis.) But between B and C the tangents have negative slope, so f 9 s xd is negative there. m=0 m=0 Pª (5, 1.5) y B A mÅ C P (a) x 1 1 0 y=ƒ y Aª Bª Cª (b) x 1 1 0 5 y=fª(x) 3 2 m=0 5 ■ x y 1 0 1 y=ƒ FIGURE 1 TEC Visual 2.8 shows an animation of Figure 2 for several functions.

SOLUTION (a) When using Equation 2 to compute a derivative, we must remember that the variable is h and that x is temporarily regarded as a constant during the calculation of the limit. f 9 s xd - lim h l 0 f s x 1 hd 2 f s xd h - lim h l 0 fs x 1 hd 3 2 s x 1 hdg 2 fx 3 2 xg h - lim h l 0 x 3 1 3x 2 h 1 3xh 2 1 h 3 2 x 2 h 2 x 3 1 x h - lim h l0 3x 2 h 1 3xh 2 1 h 3 2 h h - lim h l0 s3x 2 1 3xh 1 h 2 2 1d - 3x 2 2 1 (b) We use a graphing device to graph f and f 9 in Figure 3. Notice that f 9 s xd - 0 when f has horizontal tangents and f 9 s xd is positive when the tangents have positive slope. So these graphs serve as a check on our work in part (a). ■ EXAMPLE 3 If f s xd - sx , ind the derivative of f. State the domain of f 9 . SOLUTION f 9 s xd - lim h l0 f s x 1 hd 2 f s xd h - lim h l0 sx 1 h 2 sx h - lim h l0 S sx 1 h 2 sx h ? sx 1 h 1 sx sx 1 h 1 sx D (Rationalize the numerator.) - lim h l0 sx 1 hd 2 x h(sx 1 h 1 sx ) - lim h l0 h h(sx 1 h 1 sx ) - lim h l0 1 sx 1 h 1 sx - 1 sx 1 sx - 1 2sx We see that f 9 s xd exists if x . 0, so the domain of f 9 is s0, `d. This is slightly smaller than the domain of f , which is f0, `d. ■ Let’s check to see that the result of Example 3 is reasonable by looking at the graphs of f and f 9 in Figure 4. When x is close to 0, sx is also close to 0, so f 9 s xd - 1 y ( 2 s x ) is very large and this corresponds to the steep tangent lines near s0, 0d in Figure 4(a) and the large values of f 9 s xd just to the right of 0 in Figure 4(b). When x is large, f 9 s xd is very small and this corresponds to the latter tangent lines at the far right of the graph of f and the horizontal asymptote of the graph of f 9 .

The symbol dy y dx, which was introduced by Leibniz, should not be regarded as a ratio (for the time being); it is simply a synonym for f 9 s xd. Nonetheless, it is a very useful and suggestive notation, especially when used in conjunction with increment notation. Referring to Equation 2.7.6, we can rewrite the deinition of derivative in Leibniz nota- tion in the form dy dx - lim Dx l0 Dy Dx If we want to indicate the value of a derivative dy y dx in Leibniz notation at a speciic number a, we use the notation dy dx Z x-a or dy dx G x-a which is a synonym for f 9 sad. The vertical bar means “evaluate at.” 3 Deinition A function f is differentiable at a if f 9 sad exists. It is differen- tiable on an open interval sa, bd [or sa, `d or s2`, ad or s2`, `d] if it is differen- tiable at every number in the interval. a b 2 c d e - ad 2 bc bd ? 1 e Leibniz Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in Leipzig in 1646 and studied law, theol- ogy, philosophy, and mathematics at the university there, graduating with a bachelor’s degree at age 17. After earning his doctorate in law at age 20, Leibniz entered the diplomatic service and spent most of his life traveling to the capitals of Europe on political mis- sions. In particular, he worked to avert a French military threat against Germany and attempted to reconcile the Catholic and Protestant churches. His serious study of mathematics did not begin until 1672 while he was on a diplomatic mission in Paris. There he built a calculating machine and met scientists, like Huygens, who directed his attention to the latest developments in mathematics and science. Leibniz sought to develop a symbolic logic and system of notation that would simplify logical reasoning. In particular, the version of calculus that he published in 1684 established the notation and the rules for inding derivatives that we use today. Unfortunately, a dreadful priority dispute arose in the 1690s between the followers of Newton and those of Leibniz as to who had invented calculus irst. Leibniz was even accused of plagiarism by members of the Royal Society in Eng- land. The truth is that each man invented calculus independently. Newton arrived at his version of calculus irst but, because of his fear of controversy, did not publish it immediately. So Leibniz’s 1684 account of calculus was the irst to be published.

","156 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives EXAMPLE 5 Where is the function f s xd - | x | differentiable? SOLUTION If x . 0, then | x | - x and we can choose h small enough that x 1 h . 0 and hence | x 1 h | - x 1 h. Therefore, for x . 0, we have f 9 s xd - lim h l0 | x 1 h | 2 | x | h - lim h l0 s x 1 hd 2 x h - lim h l0 h h - lim h l0 1 - 1 and so f is differentiable for any x . 0. Similarly, for x , 0 we have | x | - 2x and h can be chosen small enough that x 1 h , 0 and so | x 1 h | - 2s x 1 hd. Therefore, for x , 0, f 9 s xd - lim h l0 | x 1 h | 2 | x | h - lim h l0 2s x 1 hd 2 s2xd h - lim h l0 2h h - lim h l0 s21d - 21 and so f is differentiable for any x , 0. For x - 0 we have to investigate f 9 s0d - lim h l 0 f s0 1 hd 2 f s0d h - lim h l 0 | 0 1 h | 2 | 0 | h - lim h l0 | h | h (if it exists) Let’s compute the left and right limits separately: lim h l0 1 | h | h - lim h l0 1 h h - lim h l0 1 1 - 1 and lim h l0 2 | h | h - lim h l0 2 2h h - lim h l0 2 s21d - 21 Since these limits are different, f 9 s0d does not exist. Thus f is differentiable at all x except 0. A formula for f 9 is given by f 9 s xd - H 1 21 if x . 0 if x , 0 and its graph is shown in Figure 5(b). The fact that f 9 s0d does not exist is relected geometrically in the fact that the curve y - | x | does not have a tangent line at s0, 0d. [See Figure 5(a).] ■ Both continuity and differentiability are desirable properties for a function to have. The following theorem shows how these properties are related. 4 Theorem If f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.

","SECTION 2.8 The Derivative as a Function 157 PROOF To prove that f is continuous at a, we have to show that lim x l a f s xd - f sad. We do this by showing that the difference f s xd 2 f sad approaches 0. The given information is that f is differentiable at a, that is, f 9 sad - lim x l a f s xd 2 f sad x 2 a exists (see Equation 2.7.5). To connect the given and the unknown, we divide and multiply f s xd 2 f sad by x 2 a (which we can do when x ± a): f s xd 2 f sad - f s xd 2 f sad x 2 a s x 2 ad Thus, using the Product Law and (2.7.5), we can write lim x l a f f s xd 2 f sadg - lim x l a f s xd 2 f sad x 2 a s x 2 ad - lim x l a f s xd 2 f sad x 2 a ? lim x l a s x 2 ad - f 9 sad ? 0 - 0 To use what we have just proved, we start with f s xd and add and subtract f sad: lim x l a f s xd - lim x l a f f sad 1 s f s xd 2 f saddg - lim x l a f sad 1 lim x l a f f s xd 2 f sadg - f sad 1 0 - f sad Therefore f is continuous at a. ■ NOTE The converse of Theorem 4 is false; that is, there are functions that are con- tinuous but not differentiable. For instance, the function f s xd - | x | is continuous at 0 because lim x l0 f s xd - lim x l0 | x | - 0 - f s0d (See Example 2.3.7.) But in Example 5 we showed that f is not differentiable at 0. How Can a Function Fail To Be Diferentiable? We saw that the function y - | x | in Example 5 is not differentiable at 0 and Figure 5(a) shows that its graph changes direction abruptly when x - 0. In general, if the graph of a function f has a “corner” or “kink” in it, then the graph of f has no tangent at this point and f is not differentiable there. [In trying to compute f 9 sad, we ind that the left and right limits are different.] Theorem 4 gives another way for a function not to have a derivative. It says that if f is not continuous at a, then f is not differentiable at a. So at any discontinuity (for instance, a jump discontinuity) f fails to be differentiable. PS An important aspect of problem solving is trying to ind a connection between the given and the unknown. See Step 2 (Think of a Plan) in Principles of Problem Solving on page 71.

","158 CHAPTER 2 Limits and Derivatives A third possibility is that the curve has a vertical tangent line when x - a; that is, f is continuous at a and lim x l a | f 9 s xd | - ` This means that the tangent lines become steeper and steeper as x l a. Figure 6 shows one way that this can happen; Figure 7(c) shows another. Figure 7 illustrates the three possibilities that we have discussed. (a) A corner (c) A vertical tangent (b) A discontinuity x y a 0 x y a 0 x y a 0 A graphing calculator or computer provides another way of looking at differen- tiability. If f is differentiable at a, then when we zoom in toward the point sa, f sadd the graph straightens out and appears more and more like a line. (See Figure 8. We saw a speciic example of this in Figure 2.7.2.) But no matter how much we zoom in toward a point like the ones in Figures 6 and 7(a), we can’t eliminate the sharp point or corner (see Figure 9). x y a 0 x y a 0 FIGURE 8 FIGURE 9 f is differentiable at a. f is not differentiable at a. Higher Derivatives If f is a differentiable function, then its derivative f 9 is also a function, so f 9 may have a derivative of its own, denoted by s f 9d 9 - f 0. This new function f 0 is called the second derivative of f because it is the derivative of the derivative of f. Using Leibniz notation, we write the second derivative of y - f sxd as d dx S dy dx D - d 2 y dx 2 derivative of first derivative second derivative FIGURE 6 vertical tangent line x y a 0 FIGURE 7 Three ways for f not to be differentiable at a Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 2.8 The Derivative as a Function 159 EXAMPLE 6 If f s xd - x 3 2 x, ind and interpret f 0s xd. SOLUTION In Example 2 we found that the irst derivative is f 9 s xd - 3x 2 2 1. So the second derivative is f 99 s xd - s f 9d9 s xd - lim h l0 f 9 s x 1 hd 2 f 9 s xd h - lim h l0 f3s x 1 hd 2 2 1g 2 f3x 2 2 1g h - lim h l0 3x 2 1 6xh 1 3h 2 2 1 2 3x 2 1 1 h - lim h l0 s6x 1 3hd - 6x The graphs of f , f 9, and f 0 are shown in Figure 10. We can interpret f 0s xd as the slope of the curve y - f 9s xd at the point s x, f 9 sxdd. In other words, it is the rate of change of the slope of the original curve y - f s xd. Notice from Figure 10 that f 0s xd is negative when y - f 9s xd has negative slope and positive when y - f 9 s xd has positive slope. So the graphs serve as a check on our calculations. ■ In general, we can interpret a second derivative as a rate of change of a rate of change. The most familiar example of this is acceleration, which we deine as follows. If s - sstd is the position function of an object that moves in a straight line, we know that its irst derivative represents the velocity v std of the object as a function of time: v std - s9 std - ds dt The instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called the accelera- tion astd of the object. Thus the acceleration function is the derivative of the velocity function and is therefore the second derivative of the position function: astd - v9 std - s 0std or, in Leibniz notation, a - dv dt - d 2 s dt 2 Acceleration is the change in velocity you feel when speeding up or slowing down in a car. The third derivative f - is the derivative of the second derivative: f -- s f 0 d9 . So f - s xd can be interpreted as the slope of the curve y - f 0s xd or as the rate of change of f 0s xd. If y - f s xd, then alternative notations for the third derivative are y - - f - s xd - d dx S d 2 y dx 2 D - d 3 y dx 3 f· fª f 1.5 _2 2 _1.5 FIGURE 10 TEC In Module 2.8 you can see how changing the coeficients of a polyno- mial f affects the appearance of the graphs of f , f 9 , and f 99 .

Because s -- ss 0 d9 - a9, the third derivative of the position function is the derivative of the accel- eration function and is called the jerk: j - da dt - d 3 s dt 3 Thus the jerk j is the rate of change of acceleration. It is aptly named because a large jerk means a sudden change in acceleration, which causes an abrupt movement in a vehicle. The differentiation process can be continued. The fourth derivative f + is usually denoted by f s4d . In general, the nth derivative of f is denoted by f snd and is obtained from f by differentiating n times. If y - f s xd, we write y snd - f snd s xd - d n y dx n EXAMPLE 7 If f s xd - x 3 2 x, ind f - s xd and f s4d s xd. SOLUTION In Example 6 we found that f 0s xd - 6 x. The graph of the second derivative has equation y - 6 x and so it is a straight line with slope 6. Since the derivative f - s xd is the slope of f 0s xd, we have f - s xd - 6 for all values of x. So f - is a constant function and its graph is a horizontal line. There- fore, for all values of x, f s4d s xd - 0 ■ We have seen that one application of second and third derivatives occurs in analyzing the motion of objects using acceleration and jerk. We will investigate another applica- tion of second derivatives in Section 4.3, where we show how knowledge of f 0 gives us information about the shape of the graph of f. In Chapter 11 we will see how second and higher derivatives enable us to represent functions as sums of ininite series. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","169 In our discussion of the principles of problem solving we considered the problem-solving strategy of introducing something extra (see page 71). In the following example we show how this principle is sometimes useful when we evaluate limits. The idea is to change the variable—to introduce a new variable that is related to the original variable—in such a way as to make the problem simpler. Later, in Section 5.5, we will make more extensive use of this general idea. EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate lim x l0 s 3 1 1 cx 2 1 x , where c is a constant. SOLUTION As it stands, this limit looks challenging. In Section 2.3 we evaluated sev- eral limits in which both numerator and denominator approached 0. There our strategy was to perform some sort of algebraic manipulation that led to a simplifying cancella- tion, but here it’s not clear what kind of algebra is necessary. So we introduce a new variable t by the equation t - s 3 1 1 cx We also need to express x in terms of t, so we solve this equation: t 3 - 1 1 cx x - t 3 2 1 c sif c ± 0d Notice that x l 0 is equivalent to t l 1. This allows us to convert the given limit into one involving the variable t: lim x l 0 s 3 1 1 cx 2 1 x - lim t l1 t 2 1 st 3 2 1dyc - lim t l1 cst 2 1d t 3 2 1 The change of variable allowed us to replace a relatively complicated limit by a simpler one of a type that we have seen before. Factoring the denominator as a difference of cubes, we get lim t l1 cst 2 1d t 3 2 1 - lim t l1 cst 2 1d st 2 1dst 2 1 t 1 1d - lim t l1 c t 2 1 t 1 1 - c 3 In making the change of variable we had to rule out the case c - 0. But if c - 0, the function is 0 for all nonzero x and so its limit is 0. Therefore, in all cases, the limit is cy3. ■ The following problems are meant to test and challenge your problem-solving skills. Some of them require a considerable amount of time to think through, so don’t be dis- couraged if you can’t solve them right away. If you get stuck, you might ind it helpful to refer to the discussion of the principles of problem solving on page 71. 1. Evaluate lim x l1 s 3 x 2 1 s x 2 1 . 2.

We have seen how to estimate derivatives of functions given by tables of values. We have learned how to graph derivatives of functions that are defined graphically. We have used the definition of a derivative to calculate the derivatives of functions defined by formulas. But it would be tedious if we always had to use the definition, so in this chapter we develop rules for finding derivatives without hav- ing to use the definition directly. These differentiation rules enable us to calculate with relative ease the derivatives of polynomials, rational functions, algebraic functions, exponential and loga- rithmic functions, and trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions. We then use these rules to solve problems involving rates of change and the approximation of functions. 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","172 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules In this section we learn how to differentiate constant functions, power functions, polyno- mials, and exponential functions. Let’s start with the simplest of all functions, the constant function f s xd - c. The graph of this function is the horizontal line y - c, which has slope 0, so we must have f 9 s xd - 0. (See Figure 1.) A formal proof, from the definition of a derivative, is also easy: f 9 s xd - lim h l 0 f s x 1 hd 2 f s xd h - lim h l 0 c 2 c h - lim h l0 0 - 0 In Leibniz notation, we write this rule as follows. Derivative of a Constant Function d dx scd - 0 Power Functions We next look at the functions f s xd - x n , where n is a positive integer. If n - 1, the graph of f s xd - x is the line y - x, which has slope 1. (See Figure 2.) So 1 d dx s xd - 1 (You can also verify Equation 1 from the definition of a derivative.) We have already investigated the cases n - 2 and n - 3. In fact, in Section 2.8 (Exercises 19 and 20) we found that 2 d dx s x 2 d - 2x d dx s x 3 d - 3x 2 For n - 4 we find the derivative of f s xd - x 4 as follows: f 9 s xd - lim h l 0 f s x 1 hd 2 f s xd h - lim h l 0 s x 1 hd 4 2 x 4 h - lim h l 0 x 4 1 4x 3 h 1 6x 2 h 2 1 4xh 3 1 h 4 2 x 4 h - lim h l 0 4x 3 h 1 6x 2 h 2 1 4xh 3 1 h 4 h - lim h l 0 s4x 3 1 6x 2 h 1 4xh 2 1 h 3 d - 4x 3 Thus 3 d dx s x 4 d - 4x 3 y c 0 x y=c slope=0 FIGURE 1 The graph of f s xd - c is the line y - c, so f 9 s xd - 0. y 0 x y=x slope=1 FIGURE 2 The graph of f s xd - x is the line y - x, so f 9 s xd - 1.

","SECTION 3.1 Derivatives of Polynomials and Exponential Functions 173 Comparing the equations in (1), (2), and (3), we see a pattern emerging. It seems to be a reasonable guess that, when n is a positive integer, sdydxds x n d - nx n21 . This turns out to be true. The Power Rule If n is a positive integer, then d dx s x n d - nx n21 FIRST PROOF The formula x n 2 a n - s x 2 ads x n21 1 x n22 a 1 ∙∙∙ 1 xa n22 1 a n21 d can be veriied simply by multiplying out the right-hand side (or by summing the sec- ond factor as a geometric series). If f s xd - x n , we can use Equation 2.7.5 for f 9 sad and the equation above to write f 9 sad - lim x l a f s xd 2 f sad x 2 a - lim x l a x n 2 a n x 2 a - lim x l a s x n21 1 x n22 a 1 ∙∙∙ 1 xa n22 1 a n21 d - a n21 1 a n22 a 1 ∙∙∙ 1 aa n22 1 a n21 - na n21 SECOND PROOF f 9 s xd - lim h l 0 f s x 1 hd 2 f s xd h - lim h l 0 s x 1 hd n 2 x n h In inding the derivative of x 4 we had to expand s x 1 hd 4 . Here we need to expand s x 1 hd n and we use the Binomial Theorem to do so: f 9 s xd - lim h l 0 F x n 1 nx n21 h 1 nsn 2 1d 2 x n22 h 2 1 ∙∙∙ 1 nxh n21 1 h n G 2 x n h - lim h l 0 nx n21 h 1 nsn 2 1d 2 x n22 h 2 1 ∙∙∙ 1 nxh n21 1 h n h - lim h l 0 F nx n21 1 nsn 2 1d 2 x n22 h 1 ∙∙∙ 1 nxh n22 1 h n21 G - nx n21 because every term except the irst has h as a factor and therefore approaches 0. ■ We illustrate the Power Rule using various notations in Example 1.

(d) d dr sr 3 d - 3r 2 ■ What about power functions with negative integer exponents? In Exercise 65 we ask you to verify from the definition of a derivative that d dx S 1 x D - 2 1 x 2 We can rewrite this equation as d dx s x 21 d - s21d x 22 and so the Power Rule is true when n - 21. In fact, we will show in the next section [Exercise 3.2.64(c)] that it holds for all negative integers. What if the exponent is a fraction? In Example 2.8.3 we found that d dx sx - 1 2 sx which can be written as d dx s x 1y2 d - 1 2 x 21y2 This shows that the Power Rule is true even when n - 1 2 . In fact, we will show in Sec- tion 3.6 that it is true for all real numbers n. The Power Rule (General Version) If n is any real number, then d dx s x n d - nx n21 EXAMPLE 2 Differentiate: (a) f s xd - 1 x 2 (b) y - s 3 x 2 SOLUTION In each case we rewrite the function as a power of x. (a) Since f s xd - x 22 , we use the Power Rule with n - 22: f 9 s xd - d dx s x 22 d - 22x 2221 - 22x 23 - 2 2 x 3 (b) dy dx - d dx ss 3 x 2 d - d dx s x 2y3 d - 2 3 x s2y3d21 - 2 3 x 21y3 ■ Observe from Figure 3 that the function y in Example 2(b) is increasing when y9 is positive and is decreasing when y9 is negative. In Chapter 4 we will prove that, in gen- eral, a function increases when its derivative is positive and decreases when its deriva- tive is negative. Figure 3 shows the function y in Example 2(b) and its derivative y9.

","SECTION 3.1 Derivatives of Polynomials and Exponential Functions 175 The Power Rule enables us to find tangent lines without having to resort to the defini- tion of a derivative. It also enables us to find normal lines. The normal line to a curve C at a point P is the line through P that is perpendicular to the tangent line at P. (In the study of optics, one needs to consider the angle between a light ray and the normal line to a lens.) EXAMPLE 3 Find equations of the tangent line and normal line to the curve y - x sx at the point s1, 1d. Illustrate by graphing the curve and these lines. SOLUTION The derivative of f s xd - x sx - xx 1y2 - x 3y2 is f 9 s xd - 3 2 x s3y2d21 - 3 2 x 1y2 - 3 2 sx So the slope of the tangent line at (1, 1) is f 9 s1d - 3 2 . Therefore an equation of the tangent line is y 2 1 - 3 2 s x 2 1d or y - 3 2 x 2 1 2 The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, so its slope is the negative recipro- cal of 3 2 , that is, 2 2 3 . Thus an equation of the normal line is y 2 1 - 2 2 3 s x 2 1d or y - 2 2 3 x 1 5 3 We graph the curve and its tangent line and normal line in Figure 4. ■ New Derivatives from Old When new functions are formed from old functions by addition, subtraction, or multiplica- tion by a constant, their derivatives can be calculated in terms of derivatives of the old functions. In particular, the following formula says that the derivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function. The Constant Multiple Rule If c is a constant and f is a differentiable func- tion, then d dx fcf s xdg - c d dx f s xd PROOF Let ts xd - cf s xd. Then t9 s xd - lim h l 0 ts x 1 hd 2 ts xd h - lim h l 0 cf s x 1 hd 2 cf s xd h - lim h l 0 c F f s x 1 hd 2 f s xd h G - c lim h l 0 f s x 1 hd 2 f s xd h (by Limit Law 3) - cf 9 s xd ■ Geometric Interpretation of the Constant Multiple Rule x y 0 y=2ƒ y=ƒ Multiplying by c - 2 stretches the graph vertically by a factor of 2.

For instance, using this theorem twice, we get s f 1 t 1 hd9 - fs f 1 td 1 hg9 - s f 1 td91 h9 - f 91 t91 h9 By writing f 2 t as f 1 s21dt and applying the Sum Rule and the Constant Multiple Rule, we get the following formula.

(The slope is proportional to the height.) Numerical evidence for the existence of f 9 s0d is given in the table at the left for the cases b - 2 and b - 3.

It appears that the limits exist and for b - 2, f 9 s0d - lim h l 0 2 h 2 1 h < 0.69 for b - 3, f 9 s0d - lim h l 0 3 h 2 1 h < 1.10 In fact, it can be proved that these limits exist and, correct to six decimal places, the values are d dx s2 x d Z x-0 < 0.693147 d dx s3 x d Z x-0 < 1.098612 Thus, from Equation 4, we have 5 d dx s2 x d<s0.69d2 x d dx s3 x d<s1.10d3 x Of all possible choices for the base b in Equation 4, the simplest differentiation formula occurs when f 9 s0d - 1. In view of the estimates of f 9 s0d for b - 2 and b - 3, it seems reasonable that there is a number b between 2 and 3 for which f 9 s0d - 1. It is traditional to denote this value by the letter e. (In fact, that is how we introduced e in Section 1.4.) Thus we have the following definition. Deinition of the Number e e is the number such that lim h l 0 e h 2 1 h - 1 In Exercise 1 we will see that e lies between 2.7 and 2.8. Later we will be able to show that, correct to five decimal places, e < 2.71828 Geometrically, this means that of all the possible exponential functions y - b x , the function f s xd - e x is the one whose tangent line at (0, 1d has a slope f 9 s0d that is exactly 1.

Derivative of the Natural Exponential Function d dx se x d - e x TEC Visual 3.1 uses the slope-a- scope to illustrate this formula. Thus the exponential function f s xd - e x has the property that it is its own derivative. The geometrical significance of this fact is that the slope of a tangent line to the curve y - e x is equal to the y-coordinate of the point (see Figure 7). EXAMPLE 8 If f s xd - e x 2 x, find f 9 and f 99. Compare the graphs of f and f 9. SOLUTION Using the Difference Rule, we have f 9 s xd - d dx se x 2 xd - d dx se x d 2 d dx s xd - e x 2 1 In Section 2.8 we defined the second derivative as the derivative of f 9, so f 99s xd - d dx se x 2 1d - d dx se x d 2 d dx s1d - e x The function f and its derivative f 9 are graphed in Figure 8. Notice that f has a hori- zontal tangent when x - 0; this corresponds to the fact that f 9 s0d - 0. Notice also that, for x . 0, f 9 s xd is positive and f is increasing. When x , 0, f 9 s xd is negative and f is decreasing. ■ EXAMPLE 9 At what point on the curve y - e x is the tangent line parallel to the line y - 2x? SOLUTION Since y - e x , we have y9 - e x . Let the x-coordinate of the point in ques- tion be a. Then the slope of the tangent line at that point is e a . This tangent line will be parallel to the line y - 2x if it has the same slope, that is, 2. Equating slopes, we get e a - 2 a - ln 2 Therefore the required point is sa, e a d - sln 2, 2d.

The Product Rule By analogy with the Sum and Difference Rules, one might be tempted to guess, as Leib- niz did three centuries ago, that the derivative of a product is the product of the deriva- tives. We can see, however, that this guess is wrong by looking at a particular example. Let f s xd - x and ts xd - x 2 . Then the Power Rule gives f 9 s xd - 1 and t9 s xd - 2x. But s f tds xd - x 3 , so s f td9 s xd - 3x 2 . Thus s f td9 ± f 9t9. The correct formula was discovered by Leibniz (soon after his false start) and is called the Product Rule. Before stating the Product Rule, let’s see how we might discover it. We start by assum- ing that u - f s xd and v - ts xd are both positive differentiable functions. Then we can interpret the product uv as an area of a rectangle (see Figure 1). If x changes by an amount D x, then the corresponding changes in u and v are Du - f s x 1Dxd 2 f s xd Dv - ts x 1Dxd 2 ts xd and the new value of the product, su 1Dudsv 1Dvd, can be interpreted as the area of the large rectangle in Figure 1 (provided that Du and Dv happen to be positive). The change in the area of the rectangle is 1 Dsuvd - su 1Dudsv 1Dvd 2 uv - u Dv 1 v Du 1Du Dv - the sum of the three shaded areas If we divide by Dx, we get Dsuvd Dx - u Dv Dx 1 v Du Dx 1Du Dv Dx u Î√ Î√ √ u√ u Îu Î√ √ Îu Îu FIGURE 1 The geometry of the Product Rule Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Although we started by assuming (for the geometric interpretation) that all the quanti- ties are positive, we notice that Equation 1 is always true. (The algebra is valid whether u, v, Du, and Dv are positive or negative.) So we have proved Equation 2, known as the Product Rule, for all differentiable functions u and v. The Product Rule If f and t are both differentiable, then d dx f f s xd ts xdg - f s xd d dx f ts xdg 1 ts xd d dx f f s xdg In prime notation: s f td9 - f t91 t f 9 In words, the Product Rule says that the derivative of a product of two functions is the irst function times the derivative of the second function plus the second function times the derivative of the irst function.

The Quotient Rule and the other differentiation formulas enable us to compute the derivative of any rational function, as the next example illustrates. EXAMPLE 4 Let y - x 2 1 x 2 2 x 3 1 6 .

Before starting this section, you might need to review the trigonometric functions. In particular, it is important to remember that when we talk about the function f defined for all real numbers x by f s xd - sin x it is understood that sin x means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is x. A simi- lar convention holds for the other trigonometric functions cos, tan, csc, sec, and cot. Recall from Section 2.5 that all of the trigonometric functions are continuous at every number in their domains. If we sketch the graph of the function f s xd - sin x and use the interpretation of f 9 s xd as the slope of the tangent to the sine curve in order to sketch the graph of f 9 (see Exer- cise 2.8.16), then it looks as if the graph of f 9 may be the same as the cosine curve (see Figure 1). x 0 2π x 0 π 2 π π 2 π ƒ= y= sin x y y fª(x y= ) FIGURE 1 TEC Visual 3.3 shows an animation of Figure 1.

Since we regard x as a constant when com- puting a limit as h l 0, we have lim h l 0 sin x - sin x and lim h l 0 cos x - cos x The limit of ssin hdy h is not so obvious. In Example 2.2.3 we made the guess, on the basis of numerical and graphical evidence, that 2 lim  l 0 sin   - 1 We now use a geometric argument to prove Equation 2.

In par- ticular, vibrations, waves, elastic motions, and other quantities that vary in a periodic manner can be described using trigonometric functions. In the following example we discuss an instance of simple harmonic motion. EXAMPLE 3 An object at the end of a vertical spring is stretched 4 cm beyond its rest position and released at time t - 0. (See Figure 5 and note that the downward direction is positive.) Its position at time t is s - f std - 4 cos t Find the velocity and acceleration at time t and use them to analyze the motion of the object. SOLUTION The velocity and acceleration are v - ds dt - d dt s4 cos td - 4 d dt scos td - 24 sin t a - dv dt - d dt s24 sin td - 24 d dt ssin td - 24 cos t The object oscillates from the lowest point ss - 4 cmd to the highest point ss - 24 cmd. The period of the oscillation is 2, the period of cos t. The speed is | v | - 4 | sin t | , which is greatest when | sin t | - 1, that is, when cos t - 0. So the object moves fastest as it passes through its equilibrium position ss - 0d. Its speed is 0 when sin t - 0, that is, at the high and low points. The acceleration a - 24 cos t - 0 when s - 0. It has greatest magnitude at the high and low points.

","198 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules Observe that F is a composite function. In fact, if we let y - f sud - su and let u - ts xd - x 2 1 1, then we can write y - Fs xd - f s ts xdd, that is, F - f 8 t. We know how to differentiate both f and t, so it would be useful to have a rule that tells us how to find the derivative of F - f 8 t in terms of the derivatives of f and t. It turns out that the derivative of the composite function f 8 t is the product of the derivatives of f and t. This fact is one of the most important of the differentiation rules and is called the Chain Rule. It seems plausible if we interpret derivatives as rates of change. Regard duy dx as the rate of change of u with respect to x, dyy du as the rate of change of y with respect to u, and dyy dx as the rate of change of y with respect to x. If u changes twice as fast as x and y changes three times as fast as u, then it seems reasonable that y changes six times as fast as x, and so we expect that dy dx - dy du du dx The Chain Rule If t is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at ts xd, then the composite function F - f 8 t defined by Fs xd - f s ts xdd is differentiable at x and F9 is given by the product F9 s xd - f 9 s ts xdd ? t9 s xd In Leibniz notation, if y - f sud and u - ts xd are both differentiable functions, then dy dx - dy du du dx COMMENTS ON THE PROOF OF THE CHAIN RULE Let Du be the change in u correspond- ing to a change of Dx in x, that is, Du - ts x 1Dxd 2 ts xd Then the corresponding change in y is Dy - f su 1Dud 2 f sud It is tempting to write dy dx - lim Dxl0 Dy Dx 1 - lim Dx l 0 Dy Du ? Du Dx - lim Dx l 0 Dy Du ? lim Dx l 0 Du Dx - lim Du l 0 Dy Du ? lim Dx l 0 Du Dx (Note that Du l 0 as Dx l 0 since t is continuous.) - dy du du dx James Gregory The irst person to formulate the Chain Rule was the Scottish mathe- matician James Gregory (1638–1675), who also designed the irst practical relecting telescope. Gregory disco- vered the basic ideas of calculus at about the same time as Newton. He became the irst Professor of Mathematics at the University of St. Andrews and later held the same position at the University of Edin- burgh. But one year after accep- ting that position he died at the age of 36. See Section 1.3 for a review of composite functions. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 3.4 The Chain Rule 199 The only law in this reasoning is that in (1) it might happen that Du - 0 (even when Dx ± 0) and, of course, we can’t divide by 0. Nonetheless, this reasoning does at least suggest that the Chain Rule is true. A full proof of the Chain Rule is given at the end of this section. ■ The Chain Rule can be written either in the prime notation 2 s f 8 td9 s xd - f 9 s ts xdd ? t9 s xd or, if y - f sud and u - ts xd, in Leibniz notation: 3 dy dx - dy du du dx Equation 3 is easy to remember because if dyy du and duy dx were quotients, then we could cancel du. Remember, however, that du has not been deined and duy dx should not be thought of as an actual quotient. EXAMPLE 1 Find F9 s xd if Fs xd - sx 2 1 1 . SOLUTION 1 (using Equation 2): At the beginning of this section we expressed F as Fs xd - s f 8 tds xd - f s ts xdd where f sud - su and ts xd - x 2 1 1. Since f 9 sud - 1 2 u 21y2 - 1 2 su and t9 s xd - 2x we have F9 s xd - f 9 s ts xdd ? t9 s xd - 1 2 sx 2 1 1 ? 2x - x sx 2 1 1 SOLUTION 2 (using Equation 3): If we let u - x 2 1 1 and y - su , then F9 s xd - dy du du dx - 1 2 su s2xd - 1 2 sx 2 1 1 s2xd - x sx 2 1 1 ■ When using Formula 3 we should bear in mind that dyy dx refers to the derivative of y when y is considered as a function of x (called the derivative of y with respect to x), whereas dyy du refers to the derivative of y when considered as a function of u (the derivative of y with respect to u). For instance, in Example 1, y can be considered as a function of x ( y - sx 2 1 1 ) and also as a function of u ( y - su ). Note that dy dx - F9 s xd - x sx 2 1 1 whereas dy du - f 9 sud - 1 2 su NOTE In using the Chain Rule we work from the outside to the inside. Formula 2 says that we differentiate the outer function f [at the inner function ts xd ] and then we multiply by the derivative of the inner function. d dx f s ts xdd - f 9 s ts xdd ? t9 s xd outer function evaluated at inner function derivative of outer function evaluated at inner function derivative of inner function Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","200 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules EXAMPLE 2 Differentiate (a) y - sins x 2 d and (b) y - sin 2 x. SOLUTION (a) If y - sins x 2 d, then the outer function is the sine function and the inner function is the squaring function, so the Chain Rule gives dy dx - d dx sin s x 2 d - cos s x 2 d ? 2x outer function evaluated at inner function derivative of outer function evaluated at inner function derivative of inner function - 2x coss x 2 d (b) Note that sin 2 x - ssin xd 2 . Here the outer function is the squaring function and the inner function is the sine function. So dy dx - d dx ssin xd 2 - 2 ? ssin xd ? cos x inner function derivative of outer function evaluated at inner function derivative of inner function The answer can be left as 2 sin x cos x or written as sin 2x (by a trigonometric identity known as the double-angle formula). ■ In Example 2(a) we combined the Chain Rule with the rule for differentiating the sine function. In general, if y - sin u, where u is a differentiable function of x, then, by the Chain Rule, dy dx - dy du du dx - cos u du dx Thus d dx ssin ud - cos u du dx In a similar fashion, all of the formulas for differentiating trigonometric functions can be combined with the Chain Rule. Let’s make explicit the special case of the Chain Rule where the outer function f is a power function. If y - f ts xdg n , then we can write y - f sud - u n where u - ts xd. By using the Chain Rule and then the Power Rule, we get dy dx - dy du du dx - nu n21 du dx - nf ts xdg n21 t9 s xd 4 The Power Rule Combined with the Chain Rule If n is any real number and u - ts xd is differentiable, then d dx su n d - nu n21 du dx Alternatively, d dx f ts xdg n - nf ts xdg n21 ? t9 s xd Notice that the derivative in Example 1 could be calculated by taking n - 1 2 in Rule 4.

Notice that y9 is large when y increases rapidly and y9 - 0 when y has a hori- zontal tangent. So our answer appears to be reasonable. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

SOLUTION Here the inner function is ts xd - sin x and the outer function is the expo- nential function f s xd - e x . So, by the Chain Rule, dy dx - d dx se sin x d - e sin x d dx ssin xd - e sin x cos x ■ We can use the Chain Rule to differentiate an exponential function with any base b . 0. Recall from Section 1.5 that b - e ln b . So b x - se ln b d x - e sln bd x and the Chain Rule gives d dx sb x d - d dx se sln bd x d - e sln bd x d dx sln bd x - e sln bd x ∙ ln b - b x ln b because ln b is a constant. So we have the formula 5 d dx sb x d - b x ln b In particular, if b - 2, we get 6 d dx s2 x d - 2 x ln 2 In Section 3.1 we gave the estimate d dx s2 x d<s0.69d2 x This is consistent with the exact formula (6) because ln 2 < 0.693147. The reason for the name “Chain Rule” becomes clear when we make a longer chain by adding another link. Suppose that y - f sud, u - ts xd, and x - hstd, where f , t, and h are differentiable functions. Then, to compute the derivative of y with respect to t, we use the Chain Rule twice: dy dt - dy dx dx dt - dy du du dx dx dt EXAMPLE 8 If f s xd - sinscosstan xdd, then f 9 s xd - cosscosstan xdd d dx cosstan xd - cosscosstan xddf2sinstan xdg d dx stan xd - 2cosscosstan xdd sinstan xd sec 2 x Notice that we used the Chain Rule twice. ■ More generally, the Chain Rule gives d dx se u d - e u du dx Don’t confuse Formula 5 (where x is the exponent) with the Power Rule (where x is the base): d dx s x n d - nx n21 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Dy - f 9 sad Dx 1« Dx If we deine « to be 0 when Dx - 0, then « becomes a continuous function of Dx. Thus, for a differentiable function f , we can write 7 Dy - f 9 sad Dx 1« Dx where « l 0 as Dx l 0 and « is a continuous function of Dx. This property of differentiable functions is what enables us to prove the Chain Rule. PROOF OF THE CHAIN RULE Suppose u - ts xd is differentiable at a and y - f sud is dif- ferentiable at b - tsad.

An approach path for an aircraft landing is shown in the figure and satisfies the following conditions: (i) The cruising altitude is h when descent starts at a horizontal distance , from touch- down at the origin. (ii) The pilot must maintain a constant horizontal speed v throughout descent. (iii) The absolute value of the vertical acceleration should not exceed a constant k (which is much less than the acceleration due to gravity). 1.

Some functions, however, are defined implicitly by a relation between x and y such as 1 x 2 1 y 2 - 25 or 2 x 3 1 y 3 - 6xy In some cases it is possible to solve such an equation for y as an explicit function (or several functions) of x. For instance, if we solve Equation 1 for y, we get y - 6s25 2 x 2 , so two of the functions determined by the implicit Equation l are f s xd - s25 2 x 2 and ts xd - 2s25 2 x 2 .

Nonetheless, (2) is the equation of a curve called the folium of Descartes shown in Figure 2 and it implicitly deines y as several functions of x. The graphs of three such functions are shown in Figure 3.

Instead we can use the method of implicit differentiation. This consists of differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x and then solving the resul- ting equation for y9. In the examples and exercises of this section it is always assumed that the given equation determines y implicitly as a differentiable function of x so that the method of implicit differentiation can be applied.

The point s3, 4d lies on the upper semicircle y - s25 2 x 2 and so we consider the function f s xd - s25 2 x 2 . Differentiating f using the Chain Rule, we have f 9 s xd - 1 2 s25 2 x 2 d 21y2 d dx s25 2 x 2 d - 1 2 s25 2 x 2 d 21y2 s22xd - 2 x s 25 2 x 2 So f 9 s3d - 2 3 s25 2 3 2 - 2 3 4 and, as in Solution 1, an equation of the tangent is 3x 1 4y - 25. ■ NOTE 1 The expression dy y dx - 2xy y in Solution 1 gives the derivative in terms of both x and y. It is correct no matter which function y is determined by the given equation. For instance, for y - f s xd - s25 2 x 2 we have dy dx - 2 x y - 2 x s25 2 x 2 whereas for y - ts xd - 2s25 2 x 2 we have dy dx - 2 x y - 2 x 2s25 2 x 2 - x s25 2 x 2 EXAMPLE 2 (a) Find y9 if x 3 1 y 3 - 6xy.

SOLUTION (a) Differentiating both sides of x 3 1 y 3 - 6xy with respect to x, regarding y as a function of x, and using the Chain Rule on the term y 3 and the Product Rule on the term 6xy, we get 3x 2 1 3y 2 y9 - 6xy91 6y or x 2 1 y 2 y9 - 2xy91 2y Example 1 illustrates that even when it is possible to solve an equation explicitly for y in terms of x, it may be easier to use implicit differentiation.

So an equation of the tangent to the folium at s3, 3d is y 2 3 - 21s x 2 3d or x 1 y - 6 (c) The tangent line is horizontal if y9 - 0. Using the expression for y9 from part (a), we see that y9 - 0 when 2y 2 x 2 - 0 (provided that y 2 2 2x ± 0d. Substituting y - 1 2 x 2 in the equation of the curve, we get x 3 1 ( 1 2 x 2 ) 3 - 6x ( 1 2 x 2 ) which simplifies to x 6 - 16x 3 . Since x ± 0 in the first quadrant, we have x 3 - 16. If x - 16 1y3 - 2 4y3 , then y - 1 2 s2 8y3 d - 2 5y3 . Thus the tangent is horizontal at s2 4y3 , 2 5y3 d, which is approximately (2.5198, 3.1748). Looking at Figure 5, we see that our answer is reasonable. ■ NOTE 2 There is a formula for the three roots of a cubic equation that is like the quadratic formula but much more complicated. If we use this formula (or a computer algebra system) to solve the equation x 3 1 y 3 - 6xy for y in terms of x, we get three functions determined by the equation: y - f s xd - s 3 2 1 2 x 3 1 s 1 4 x 6 2 8x 3 1 s 3 2 1 2 x 3 2 s 1 4 x 6 2 8x 3 and y - 1 2 f 2f s xd 6 s23 (s 3 2 1 2 x 3 1 s 1 4 x 6 2 8x 3 2 s 3 2 1 2 x 3 2 s 1 4 x 6 2 8x 3 ) g (These are the three functions whose graphs are shown in Figure 3.) You can see that the method of implicit differentiation saves an enormous amount of work in cases such as this. Moreover, implicit differentiation works just as easily for equations such as y 5 1 3x 2 y 2 1 5x 4 - 12 for which it is impossible to find a similar expression for y in terms of x.

This is plausible because the graph of a differentiable function has no corner or kink and so if we relect it about y - x, the graph of its inverse function also has no corner or kink.] Recall the deinition of the arcsine function: y - sin 21 x means sin y - x and 2  2 < y <  2 Differentiating sin y - x implicitly with respect to x, we obtain cos y dy dx - 1 or dy dx - 1 cos y Now cos y > 0, since 2y2 < y < y2, so cos y - s1 2 sin 2 y - s1 2 x 2 FIGURE 10 Figure 10 shows the graph of the curve x 4 1 y 4 - 16 of Example 4.

","224 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules We know that if y - f s xd, then the derivative dy y dx can be interpreted as the rate of change of y with respect to x. In this section we examine some of the applications of this idea to physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and other sciences. Let’s recall from Section 2.7 the basic idea behind rates of change. If x changes from x 1 to x 2 , then the change in x is Dx - x 2 2 x 1 and the corresponding change in y is Dy - f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d The difference quotient Dy Dx - f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d x 2 2 x 1 is the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval f x 1 , x 2 g and can be interpreted as the slope of the secant line PQ in Figure 1. Its limit as Dx l 0 is the derivative f 9 s x 1 d, which can therefore be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x or the slope of the tangent line at Ps x 1 , f s x 1 dd. Using Leibniz nota- tion, we write the process in the form dy dx - lim Dx l0 Dy Dx Whenever the function y - f s xd has a specific interpretation in one of the sciences, its derivative will have a specific interpretation as a rate of change. (As we discussed in Sec- tion 2.7, the units for dy y dx are the units for y divided by the units for x.) We now look at some of these interpretations in the natural and social sciences. Physics If s - f std is the position function of a particle that is moving in a straight line, then Dsy Dt represents the average velocity over a time period Dt, and v - ds y dt represents the instan- taneous velocity (the rate of change of displacement with respect to time). The instanta- neous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is acceleration: as t d - v9s t d - s99s t d. This was discussed in Sections 2.7 and 2.8, but now that we know the differentiation formulas, we are able to solve problems involving the motion of objects more easily. EXAMPLE 1 The position of a particle is given by the equation s - f std - t 3 2 6t 2 1 9t where t is measured in seconds and s in meters. (a) Find the velocity at time t. (b) What is the velocity after 2 s? After 4 s? (c) When is the particle at rest? (d) When is the particle moving forward (that is, in the positive direction)?

Thus the particle is at rest after 1 s and after 3 s. (d) The particle moves in the positive direction when vstd . 0, that is, 3t 2 2 12t 1 9 - 3st 2 1dst 2 3d . 0 This inequality is true when both factors are positive st . 3d or when both factors are negative st , 1d. Thus the particle moves in the positive direction in the time intervals t , 1 and t . 3. It moves backward (in the negative direction) when 1 , t , 3. (e) Using the information from part (d) we make a schematic sketch in Figure 2 of the motion of the particle back and forth along a line (the s-axis). (f ) Because of what we learned in parts (d) and (e), we need to calculate the distances traveled during the time intervals [0, 1], [1, 3], and [3, 5] separately. The distance traveled in the first second is | f s1d 2 f s0d | - | 4 2 0 | - 4 m From t - 1 to t - 3 the distance traveled is | f s3d 2 f s1d | - | 0 2 4 | - 4 m From t - 3 to t - 5 the distance traveled is | f s5d 2 f s3d | - | 20 2 0 | - 20 m The total distance is 4 1 4 1 20 - 28 m.

","226 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules ( i) The particle speeds up when the velocity is positive and increasing (v and a are both positive) and also when the velocity is negative and decreasing (v and a are both negative). In other words, the particle speeds up when the velocity and acceleration have the same sign. (The particle is pushed in the same direction it is moving.) From Figure 3 we see that this happens when 1 , t , 2 and when t . 3. The particle slows down when v and a have opposite signs, that is, when 0 < t , 1 and when 2 , t , 3. Figure 4 summarizes the motion of the particle. 1 5 _5 √ s a forward slows down slows down backward speeds up speeds up forward t 0 ■ EXAMPLE 2 If a rod or piece of wire is homogeneous, then its linear density is uniform and is defined as the mass per unit length s  - myl d and measured in kilograms per meter. Suppose, however, that the rod is not homogeneous but that its mass measured from its left end to a point x is m - f s xd, as shown in Figure 5. x¡ x™ This part of the rod has mass ƒ. x The mass of the part of the rod that lies between x - x 1 and x - x 2 is given by Dm - f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d, so the average density of that part of the rod is average density - Dm Dx - f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d x 2 2 x 1 If we now let Dx l 0 (that is, x 2 l x 1 ), we are computing the average density over smaller and smaller intervals. The linear density  at x 1 is the limit of these average densities as Dx l 0; that is, the linear density is the rate of change of mass with respect to length. Symbolically,  - lim Dx l0 Dm Dx - dm dx Thus the linear density of the rod is the derivative of mass with respect to length. For instance, if m - f s xd - sx , where x is measured in meters and m in kilograms, then the average density of the part of the rod given by 1 < x < 1.2 is Dm Dx - f s1.2d 2 f s1d 1.2 2 1 - s1.2 2 1 0.2 < 0.48 kgy m TEC In Module 3.7 you can see an animation of Figure 4 with an expression for s that you can choose yourself.

Figure 6 shows part of a wire and electrons moving through a plane surface, shaded red. If DQ is the net charge that passes through this surface during a time period Dt, then the average cur- rent during this time interval is defined as average current - DQ Dt - Q 2 2 Q 1 t 2 2 t 1 If we take the limit of this average current over smaller and smaller time intervals, we get what is called the current I at a given time t 1 : I - lim Dt l 0 DQ Dt - dQ dt Thus the current is the rate at which charge lows through a surface. It is measured in units of charge per unit time (often coulombs per second, called amperes). ■ Velocity, density, and current are not the only rates of change that are important in physics. Others include power (the rate at which work is done), the rate of heat low, temperature gradient (the rate of change of temperature with respect to position), and the rate of decay of a radioactive substance in nuclear physics. Chemistry EXAMPLE 4 A chemical reaction results in the formation of one or more substances (called products) from one or more starting materials (called reactants). For instance, the “equation” 2H 2 1 O 2 l 2H 2 O indicates that two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen form two mol- ecules of water. Let’s consider the reaction A 1 B l C where A and B are the reactants and C is the product. The concentration of a reactant A is the number of moles (1 mole - 6.022 3 10 23 molecules) per liter and is denoted by fAg. The concentration varies during a reaction, so fAg, fBg, and fCg are all func- tions of time std. The average rate of reaction of the product C over a time interval t 1 < t < t 2 is DfCg Dt - fCgst 2 d 2 fCgst 1 d t 2 2 t 1 But chemists are more interested in the instantaneous rate of reaction, which is obtained by taking the limit of the average rate of reaction as the time interval Dt approaches 0: rate of reaction - lim Dt l0 DfCg Dt - d fCg dt - - - - - - - FIGURE 6 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","228 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules Since the concentration of the product increases as the reaction proceeds, the derivative d fCgydt will be positive, and so the rate of reaction of C is positive. The concentrations of the reactants, however, decrease during the reaction, so, to make the rates of reaction of A and B positive numbers, we put minus signs in front of the derivatives d fAgydt and d fBgydt. Since f Ag and fBg each decrease at the same rate that fCg increases, we have rate of reaction - d fCg dt - 2 d fAg dt - 2 d fBg dt More generally, it turns out that for a reaction of the form aA 1 bB l c C 1 d D we have 2 1 a d fAg dt - 2 1 b d fBg dt - 1 c d fCg dt - 1 d d fDg dt The rate of reaction can be determined from data and graphical methods. In some cases there are explicit formulas for the concentrations as functions of time, which enable us to compute the rate of reaction (see Exercise 24). ■ EXAMPLE 5 One of the quantities of interest in thermodynamics is compressibility. If a given substance is kept at a constant temperature, then its volume V depends on its pressure P. We can consider the rate of change of volume with respect to pressure— namely, the derivative dV ydP. As P increases, V decreases, so dV ydP , 0. The com- pressibility is defined by introducing a minus sign and dividing this derivative by the volume V : isothermal compressibility -  - 2 1 V dV dP Thus  measures how fast, per unit volume, the volume of a substance decreases as the pressure on it increases at constant temperature. For instance, the volume V (in cubic meters) of a sample of air at 25 8 C was found to be related to the pressure P (in kilopascals) by the equation V - 5.3 P The rate of change of V with respect to P when P - 50 kPa is dV dP Z P-50 - 2 5.3 P 2 Z P-50 - 2 5.3 2500 - 20.00212 m 3 ykPa The compressibility at that pressure is  - 2 1 V dV dP Z P-50 - 0.00212 5.3 50 - 0.02 sm 3 ykPadym 3 ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The change in the population size between the times t - t 1 and t - t 2 is Dn - f st 2 d 2 f st 1 d, and so the average rate of growth during the time period t 1 < t < t 2 is average rate of growth - Dn Dt - f st 2 d 2 f st 1 d t 2 2 t 1 The instantaneous rate of growth is obtained from this average rate of growth by let- ting the time period Dt approach 0: growth rate - lim Dt l0 Dn Dt - dn dt Strictly speaking, this is not quite accurate because the actual graph of a population function n - f std would be a step function that is discontinuous whenever a birth or death occurs and therefore not differentiable. However, for a large animal or plant population, we can replace the graph by a smooth approximating curve as in Figure 7. t n 0 To be more specific, consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient medium. Suppose that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is determined that the population doubles every hour.

R r l Because of friction at the walls of the tube, the velocity v of the blood is greatest along the central axis of the tube and decreases as the distance r from the axis increases until v becomes 0 at the wall. The relationship between v and r is given by the law of lami- nar low discovered by the French physician Jean-Louis-Marie Poiseuille in 1840. This law states that 1 v - P 4l sR 2 2 r 2 d where  is the viscosity of the blood and P is the pressure difference between the ends of the tube. If P and l are constant, then v is a function of r with domain f0, Rg. The average rate of change of the velocity as we move from r - r 1 outward to r - r 2 is given by Dv Dr - vsr 2 d 2 vsr 1 d r 2 2 r 1 and if we let Dr l 0, we obtain the velocity gradient, that is, the instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to r : velocity gradient - lim Dr l 0 Dv Dr - dv dr Using Equation 1, we obtain dv dr - P 4l s0 2 2rd - 2 Pr 2l FIGURE 8 Blood low in an artery For more detailed information, see W.

Then the radius of the artery is 80 mm. The velocity at the central axis is 11,850 mmys, which decreases to 11,110 mmys at a distance of r - 20 mm. The fact that dv y dr - 274 (mmys)ymm means that, when r - 20 mm, the velocity is decreasing at a rate of about 74 mmys for each micrometer that we proceed away from the center. ■ Economics EXAMPLE 8 Suppose Cs xd is the total cost that a company incurs in producing x units of a certain commodity. The function C is called a cost function. If the number of items produced is increased from x 1 to x 2 , then the additional cost is DC - Cs x 2 d 2 Cs x 1 d, and the average rate of change of the cost is DC Dx - Cs x 2 d 2 Cs x 1 d x 2 2 x 1 - Cs x 1 1Dxd 2 Cs x 1 d Dx The limit of this quantity as Dx l 0, that is, the instantaneous rate of change of cost with respect to the number of items produced, is called the marginal cost by economists: marginal cost - lim Dx l0 DC Dx - dC dx [Since x often takes on only integer values, it may not make literal sense to let Dx approach 0, but we can always replace Cs xd by a smooth approximating function as in Example 6.] Taking Dx - 1 and n large (so that Dx is small compared to n), we have C9 snd< Csn 1 1d 2 Csnd Thus the marginal cost of producing n units is approximately equal to the cost of pro- ducing one more unit [the sn 1 1dst unit]. It is often appropriate to represent a total cost function by a polynomial Cs xd - a 1 bx 1 cx 2 1 dx 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(The cost of raw materials may be proportional to x, but labor costs might depend partly on higher powers of x because of overtime costs and ineficiencies involved in large-scale operations.) For instance, suppose a company has estimated that the cost (in dollars) of produc- ing x items is Cs xd - 10,000 1 5x 1 0.01x 2 Then the marginal cost function is C9 s xd - 5 1 0.02x The marginal cost at the production level of 500 items is C9 s500d - 5 1 0.02s500d - $15 yitem This gives the rate at which costs are increasing with respect to the production level when x - 500 and predicts the cost of the 501st item.

These will be considered in Chapter 4 after we have developed techniques for inding the maximum and minimum values of functions. Other Sciences Rates of change occur in all the sciences. A geologist is interested in knowing the rate at which an intruded body of molten rock cools by conduction of heat into surrounding rocks. An engineer wants to know the rate at which water lows into or out of a reservoir. An urban geographer is interested in the rate of change of the population density in a city as the distance from the city center increases. A meteorologist is concerned with the rate of change of atmospheric pressure with respect to height (see Exercise 3.8.19). In psychology, those interested in learning theory study the so-called learning curve, which graphs the performance Pstd of someone learning a skill as a function of the training time t. Of particular interest is the rate at which performance improves as time passes, that is, dP ydt. In sociology, differential calculus is used in analyzing the spread of rumors (or innova- tions or fads or fashions). If pstd denotes the proportion of a population that knows a rumor by time t, then the derivative dp y dt represents the rate of spread of the rumor (see Exer- cise 3.4.84).

","SECTION 3.7 Rates of Change in the Natural and Social Sciences 233 marginal cost and marginal proit in economics; rate of heat low in geology; rate of improvement of performance in psychology; rate of spread of a rumor in sociology— these are all special cases of a single mathematical concept, the derivative. This is an illustration of the fact that part of the power of mathematics lies in its abstractness. A single abstract mathematical concept (such as the derivative) can have dif- ferent interpretations in each of the sciences. When we develop the properties of the mathematical concept once and for all, we can then turn around and apply these results to all of the sciences. This is much more eficient than developing properties of special con- cepts in each separate science. The French mathematician Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) put it succinctly: “Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret analogies that unite them.” 3.7 EXERCISES 7.

","SECTION 3.8 Exponential Growth and Decay 237 In many natural phenomena, quantities grow or decay at a rate proportional to their size. For instance, if y - f s t d is the number of individuals in a population of animals or bac- teria at time t, then it seems reasonable to expect that the rate of growth f 9 s t d is propor- tional to the population f s t d; that is, f 9 s t d - kf s t d for some constant k. Indeed, under ideal conditions (unlimited environment, adequate nutrition, immunity to disease) the mathematical model given by the equation f 9 s t d - kf s t d predicts what actually happens fairly accurately. Another example occurs in nuclear physics where the mass of a radio- active substance decays at a rate proportional to the mass. In chemistry, the rate of a unimolecular irst-order reaction is proportional to the concentration of the substance. In inance, the value of a savings account with continuously compounded interest increases at a rate proportional to that value. In general, if y s t d is the value of a quantity y at time t and if the rate of change of y with respect to t is proportional to its size y s t d at any time, then 1 dy dt - ky where k is a constant. Equation 1 is sometimes called the law of natural growth (if k . 0d or the law of natural decay (if k , 0). It is called a differential equation because it involves an unknown function y and its derivative dyy dt. It’s not hard to think of a solution of Equation 1. This equation asks us to ind a func- tion whose derivative is a constant multiple of itself. We have met such functions in this chapter. Any exponential function of the form ys t d - Ce kt , where C is a constant, satisies y9 s t d - Cske kt d - ksCe kt d - ky s td We will see in Section 9.4 that any function that satisies dyy dt - ky must be of the form y - Ce kt . To see the signiicance of the constant C, we observe that ys0d - Ce k?0 - C Therefore C is the initial value of the function. 2 Theorem The only solutions of the differential equation dyy dt - ky are the exponential functions ys t d - ys0d e kt Population Growth What is the signiicance of the proportionality constant k? In the context of population growth, where Ps t d is the size of a population at time t, we can write 3 dP dt - kP or 1 P dP dt - k The quantity 1 P dP dt is the growth rate divided by the population size; it is called the relative growth rate.

","238 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules According to (3), instead of saying “the growth rate is proportional to population size” we could say “the relative growth rate is constant.” Then (2) says that a population with constant relative growth rate must grow exponentially. Notice that the relative growth rate k appears as the coeficient of t in the exponential function Ce kt . For instance, if dP dt - 0.02P and t is measured in years, then the relative growth rate is k - 0.02 and the population grows at a relative rate of 2% per year. If the population at time 0 is P 0 , then the expres- sion for the population is Pstd - P 0 e 0.02 t EXAMPLE 1 Use the fact that the world population was 2560 million in 1950 and 3040 million in 1960 to model the population of the world in the second half of the 20th century. (Assume that the growth rate is proportional to the population size.) What is the relative growth rate? Use the model to estimate the world population in 1993 and to predict the population in the year 2020. SOLUTION We measure the time t in years and let t - 0 in the year 1950. We measure the population Pstd in millions of people. Then Ps0d - 2560 and Ps10d - 3040. Since we are assuming that dPydt - kP, Theorem 2 gives Pstd - Ps0de kt - 2560e kt Ps10d - 2560e 10k - 3040 k - 1 10 ln 3040 2560 < 0.017185 The relative growth rate is about 1.7% per year and the model is Pstd - 2560e 0.017185 t We estimate that the world population in 1993 was Ps43d - 2560e 0.017185s43d < 5360 million The model predicts that the population in 2020 will be Ps70d - 2560e 0.017185s70d < 8524 million The graph in Figure 1 shows that the model is fairly accurate to the end of the 20th cen- tury (the dots represent the actual population), so the estimate for 1993 is quite reliable. But the prediction for 2020 is riskier. 6000 P t 20 0 40 Years since 1950 Population (in millions) P=2560e 0.017185t ■ FIGURE 1 A model for world population growth in the second half of the 20th century Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 3.8 Exponential Growth and Decay 239 Radioactive Decay Radioactive substances decay by spontaneously emitting radiation. If mstd is the mass remaining from an initial mass m 0 of the substance after time t, then the relative decay rate 2 1 m dm dt has been found experimentally to be constant. (Since dmy dt is negative, the relative decay rate is positive.) It follows that dm dt - km where k is a negative constant. In other words, radioactive substances decay at a rate proportional to the remaining mass. This means that we can use (2) to show that the mass decays exponentially: mstd - m 0 e kt Physicists express the rate of decay in terms of half-life, the time required for half of any given quantity to decay.

(b) Find the mass after 1000 years correct to the nearest milligram. (c) When will the mass be reduced to 30 mg? SOLUTION (a) Let mstd be the mass of radium-226 (in milligrams) that remains after t years. Then dmy dt - km and ms0d - 100, so (2) gives mstd - ms0de kt - 100e kt In order to determine the value of k, we use the fact that ms1590d - 1 2 s100d. Thus 100e 1590k - 50 so e 1590k - 1 2 and 1590k - ln 1 2 - 2ln 2 k - 2 ln 2 1590 Therefore mstd - 100e 2sln 2dty1590 We could use the fact that e ln 2 - 2 to write the expression for mstd in the alternative form mstd - 100 3 2 2ty1590 (b) The mass after 1000 years is ms1000d - 100e 2sln 2d1000y1590 < 65 mg (c) We want to ind the value of t such that mstd - 30, that is, 100e 2sln 2dty1590 - 30 or e 2sln 2dty1590 - 0.3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

These curves intersect when t < 2800, and this agrees with the answer to part (c). Newton’s Law of Cooling Newton’s Law of Cooling states that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings, provided that this dif- ference is not too large. (This law also applies to warming.) If we let Ts t d be the temper- ature of the object at time t and T s be the temperature of the surroundings, then we can formulate Newton’s Law of Cooling as a differential equation: dT dt - k s T 2 T s d where k is a constant. This equation is not quite the same as Equation 1, so we make the change of variable y s td - Ts td 2 T s . Because T s is constant, we have y 9s td - T 9s td and so the equation becomes dy dt - ky We can then use (2) to find an expression for y, from which we can find T.

Continuously Compounded Interest EXAMPLE 4 If $1000 is invested at 6% interest, compounded annually, then after 1 year the investment is worth $1000s1.06d - $1060, after 2 years it’s worth $f1000s1.06dg1.06 - $1123.60, and after t years it’s worth $1000s1.06d t . In general, if an amount A 0 is invested at an interest rate r sr - 0.06 in this example), then after t years it’s worth A 0 s1 1 r d t . Usually, however, interest is compounded more fre- quently, say, n times a year. Then in each compounding period the interest rate is ry n and there are nt compounding periods in t years, so the value of the investment is A 0S 1 1 r n D nt For instance, after 3 years at 6% interest a $1000 investment will be worth $1000s1.06d 3 - $1191.02 with annual compounding $1000s1.03d 6 - $1194.05 with semiannual compounding $1000s1.015d 12 - $1195.62 with quarterly compounding $1000s1.005d 36 - $1196.68 with monthly compounding $1000 S 1 1 0.06 365 D 365 ? 3 - $1197.20 with daily compounding 72 T t 60 0 30 90 44 FIGURE 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","242 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules You can see that the interest paid increases as the number of compounding periods snd increases.

So with continuous compounding of interest at interest rate r, the amount after t years is Astd - A 0 e rt If we differentiate this equation, we get dA dt - rA 0 e rt - rAstd which says that, with continuous compounding of interest, the rate of increase of an investment is proportional to its size. Returning to the example of $1000 invested for 3 years at 6% interest, we see that with continuous compounding of interest the value of the investment will be As3d - $1000e s0.06d3 - $1197.22 Notice how close this is to the amount we calculated for daily compounding, $1197.20. But the amount is easier to compute if we use continuous compounding. ■ 3.8 EXERCISES 1. A population of protozoa develops with a constant relative growth rate of 0.7944 per member per day.

Scientists can determine the age of ancient objects by the method of radiocarbon dating. The bombardment of the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays converts nitrogen to a radioactive isotope of carbon, 14 C, with a half-life of about 5730 years. Vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide through the atmosphere and animal life assimilates 14 C through food chains. When a plant or animal dies, it stops replacing its carbon and the amount of 14 C begins to decrease through radioactive decay. Therefore the level of radioactivity must also decay exponentially. A discovery revealed a parchment fragment that had about 74% as much 14 C radioactivity as does plant material on the earth today. Estimate the age of the parchment. 12. Dinosaur fossils are too old to be reliably dated using carbon-14. (See Exercise 11.) Suppose we had a 68-million- year-old dinosaur fossil.

","244 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules A typical volume of blood in the human body is about 5 L. A certain percentage of that volume (called the hematocrit) consists of red blood cells (RBCs); typically the hematocrit is about 45% in males. Suppose that a surgery takes four hours and a male patient bleeds 2.5 L of blood. During surgery the patient’s blood volume is maintained at 5 L by injection of saline solu- tion, which mixes quickly with the blood but dilutes it so that the hematocrit decreases as time passes. 1. Assuming that the rate of RBC loss is proportional to the volume of RBCs, determine the patient’s volume of RBCs by the end of the operation. 2. A procedure called acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) has been developed to minimize RBC loss during surgery. In this procedure blood is extracted from the patient before the operation and replaced with saline solution. This dilutes the patient’s blood, resulting in fewer RBCs being lost during the bleeding. The extracted blood is then returned to the patient after surgery. Only a certain amount of blood can be extracted, however, because the RBC concentration can never be allowed to drop below 25% during surgery. What is the maximum amount of blood that can be extracted in the ANH procedure for the surgery described in this project? 3. What is the RBC loss without the ANH procedure?

","SECTION 3.9 Related Rates 245 If we are pumping air into a balloon, both the volume and the radius of the balloon are increasing and their rates of increase are related to each other. But it is much easier to measure directly the rate of increase of the volume than the rate of increase of the radius. In a related rates problem the idea is to compute the rate of change of one quantity in terms of the rate of change of another quantity (which may be more easily measured). The procedure is to find an equation that relates the two quantities and then use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides with respect to time. EXAMPLE 1 Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a rate of 100 cm 3 y s. How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the diam- eter is 50 cm? SOLUTION We start by identifying two things: the given information: the rate of increase of the volume of air is 100 cm 3 y s and the unknown: the rate of increase of the radius when the diameter is 50 cm In order to express these quantities mathematically, we introduce some suggestive notation: Let V be the volume of the balloon and let r be its radius. The key thing to remember is that rates of change are derivatives. In this problem, the volume and the radius are both functions of the time t. The rate of increase of the vol- ume with respect to time is the derivative dV ydt, and the rate of increase of the radius is dr y dt. We can therefore restate the given and the unknown as follows: Given: dV dt - 100 cm 3 y s Unknown: dr dt when r - 25 cm In order to connect dV ydt and dr y dt, we first relate V and r by the formula for the volume of a sphere: V - 4 3 r 3 In order to use the given information, we differentiate each side of this equation with respect to t. To differentiate the right side, we need to use the Chain Rule: dV dt - dV dr dr dt - 4r 2 dr dt Now we solve for the unknown quantity: dr dt - 1 4r 2 dV dt PS According to the Principles of Prob- lem Solving discussed on page 71, the irst step is to understand the problem. This includes reading the problem carefully, identifying the given and the unknown, and introducing suitable notation. PS The second stage of problem solv- ing is to think of a plan for connecting the given and the unknown. Notice that, although dVydt is constant, dry dt is not constant.

If the bottom of the lad- der slides away from the wall at a rate of 1 fty s, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 ft from the wall? SOLUTION We first draw a diagram and label it as in Figure 1. Let x feet be the dis- tance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall and y feet the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. Note that x and y are both functions of t (time, measured in seconds). We are given that dx ydt - 1 ftys and we are asked to find dy ydt when x - 6 ft (see Figure 2). In this problem, the relationship between x and y is given by the Pythagorean Theorem: x 2 1 y 2 - 100 Differentiating each side with respect to t using the Chain Rule, we have 2x dx dt 1 2y dy dt - 0 and solving this equation for the desired rate, we obtain dy dt - 2 x y dx dt When x - 6, the Pythagorean Theorem gives y - 8 and so, substituting these values and dx ydt - 1, we have dy dt - 2 6 8 s1d - 2 3 4 fty s The fact that dyydt is negative means that the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground is decreasing at a rate of 3 4 fty s. In other words, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 3 4 fty s. ■ EXAMPLE 3 A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone with base radius 2 m and height 4 m.

We are given that dV ydt - 2 m 3 ymin and we are asked to find dhy dt when h is 3 m.

Read the problem carefully. 2. Draw a diagram if possible. 3. Introduce notation. Assign symbols to all quantities that are functions of time. 4. Express the given information and the required rate in terms of derivatives. 5. Write an equation that relates the various quantities of the problem. If necessary, use the geometry of the situation to eliminate one of the variables by substitution (as in Example 3). 6. Use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to t. 7. Substitute the given information into the resulting equation and solve for the unknown rate. The following examples are further illustrations of the strategy. EXAMPLE 4 Car A is traveling west at 50 mi yh and car B is traveling north at 60 mi yh. Both are headed for the intersection of the two roads. At what rate are the cars approaching each other when car A is 0.3 mi and car B is 0.4 mi from the intersection? SOLUTION We draw Figure 4, where C is the intersection of the roads. At a given time t, let x be the distance from car A to C, let y be the distance from car B to C, and let z be the distance between the cars, where x, y, and z are measured in miles. We are given that dxy dt - 250 miyh and dy y dt - 260 miyh. (The derivatives are negative because x and y are decreasing.) We are asked to find dz y dt. The equation that C z y x B A FIGURE 4 PS Look back: What have we learned from Examples 1–3 that will help us solve future problems? WARNING A common error is to substitute the given numerical information (for quantities that vary with time) too early. This should be done only after the differentiation. (Step 7 follows Step 6.) For instance, in Example 3 we dealt with general values of h until we finally substituted h - 3 at the last stage. (If we had put h - 3 earlier, we would have gotten dV ydt - 0, which is clearly wrong.) Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In other words, we use the tangent line at sa, f sadd as an approximation to the curve y - f s xd when x is near a. An equation of this tangent line is y - f sad 1 f 9 sads x 2 ad and the approximation 1 f s xd< f sad 1 f 9 sads x 2 ad is called the linear approximation or tangent line approximation of f at a. The linear function whose graph is this tangent line, that is, 2 Ls xd - f sad 1 f 9 sads x 2 ad is called the linearization of f at a. EXAMPLE 1 Find the linearization of the function f s xd - sx 1 3 at a - 1 and use it to approximate the numbers s3.98 and s4.05 . Are these approximations over- estimates or underestimates? SOLUTION The derivative of f s xd - s x 1 3d 1y2 is f 9 s xd - 1 2 s x 1 3d 21y2 - 1 2 sx 1 3 and so we have f s1d - 2 and f 9 s1d - 1 4 . Putting these values into Equation 2, we see that the linearization is Ls xd - f s1d 1 f 9 s1ds x 2 1d - 2 1 1 4 s x 2 1d - 7 4 1 x 4 The corresponding linear approximation (1) is sx 1 3 < 7 4 1 x 4 (when x is near 1) In particular, we have s3.98 < 7 4 1 0.98 4 - 1.995 and s4.05 < 7 4 1 1.05 4 - 2.0125 The linear approximation is illustrated in Figure 2. We see that, indeed, the tangent line approximation is a good approximation to the given function when x is near l. We also see that our approximations are overestimates because the tangent line lies above the curve.

How good is the approximation that we obtained in Example 1? The next example shows that by using a graphing calculator or computer we can determine an interval throughout which a linear approximation provides a speciied accuracy. EXAMPLE 2 For what values of x is the linear approximation sx 1 3 < 7 4 1 x 4 accurate to within 0.5? What about accuracy to within 0.1? SOLUTION Accuracy to within 0.5 means that the functions should differ by less than 0.5: Z sx 1 3 2 S 7 4 1 x 4 D Z , 0.5 Equivalently, we could write sx 1 3 2 0.5 , 7 4 1 x 4 , sx 1 3 1 0.5 This says that the linear approximation should lie between the curves obtained by shift- ing the curve y - sx 1 3 upward and downward by an amount 0.5. Figure 3 shows the tangent line y - s7 1 xdy4 intersecting the upper curve y - sx 1 3 1 0.5 at P and Q. Zooming in and using the cursor, we estimate that the x-coordinate of P is about 22.66 and the x-coordinate of Q is about 8.66. Thus we see from the graph that the approximation sx 1 3 < 7 4 1 x 4 is accurate to within 0.5 when 22.6 , x , 8.6. (We have rounded to be safe.) Similarly, from Figure 4 we see that the approximation is accurate to within 0.1 when 21.1 , x , 3.9. ■ Applications to Physics Linear approximations are often used in physics.

","254 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules ics textbooks obtain the expression a T - 2t sin  for tangential acceleration and then replace sin  by  with the remark that sin  is very close to  if  is not too large. [See, for example, Physics: Calculus, 2d ed., by Eugene Hecht (Paciic Grove, CA: Brooks/ Cole, 2000), p. 431.] You can verify that the linearization of the function f s xd - sin x at a - 0 is Ls xd - x and so the linear approximation at 0 is sin x < x (see Exercise 42). So, in effect, the derivation of the formula for the period of a pendulum uses the tangent line approximation for the sine function. Another example occurs in the theory of optics, where light rays that arrive at shallow angles relative to the optical axis are called paraxial rays. In paraxial (or Gaussian) optics, both sin  and cos  are replaced by their linearizations. In other words, the linear approximations sin  <  and cos  < 1 are used because  is close to 0. The results of calculations made with these approxima- tions became the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses. [See Optics, 4th ed., by Eugene Hecht (San Francisco, 2002), p. 154.] In Section 11.11 we will present several other applications of the idea of linear approxi- mations to physics and engineering. Diferentials The ideas behind linear approximations are sometimes formulated in the terminology and notation of differentials. If y - f s xd, where f is a differentiable function, then the differ- ential dx is an independent variable; that is, dx can be given the value of any real number. The differential dy is then deined in terms of dx by the equation 3 dy - f 9 s xd dx So dy is a dependent variable; it depends on the values of x and dx. If dx is given a spe- ciic value and x is taken to be some speciic number in the domain of f , then the numer- ical value of dy is determined. The geometric meaning of differentials is shown in Figure 5. Let Ps x, f s xdd and Qs x 1Dx, f s x 1Dxdd be points on the graph of f and let dx - Dx. The corresponding change in y is Dy - f s x 1Dxd 2 f s xd The slope of the tangent line PR is the derivative f 9 s xd. Thus the directed distance from S to R is f 9 s xd dx - dy. Therefore dy represents the amount that the tangent line rises or falls (the change in the linearization), whereas Dy represents the amount that the curve y - f s xd rises or falls when x changes by an amount dx. EXAMPLE 3 Compare the values of Dy and dy if y - f s xd - x 3 1 x 2 2 2x 1 1 and x changes (a) from 2 to 2.05 and (b) from 2 to 2.01.

Notice also that dy was easier to compute than Dy. For more complicated functions it may be impossible to compute Dy exactly. In such cases the approximation by differentials is especially useful. In the notation of differentials, the linear approximation (1) can be written as f sa 1 dxd< f sad 1 dy For instance, for the function f s xd - sx 1 3 in Example 1, we have dy - f 9 s xd dx - dx 2 sx 1 3 If a - 1 and dx - Dx - 0.05, then dy - 0.05 2 s1 1 3 - 0.0125 and s4.05 - f s1.05d< f s1d 1 dy - 2.0125 just as we found in Example 1. Our inal example illustrates the use of differentials in estimating the errors that occur because of approximate measurements. EXAMPLE 4 The radius of a sphere was measured and found to be 21 cm with a pos- sible error in measurement of at most 0.05 cm. What is the maximum error in using this value of the radius to compute the volume of the sphere? SOLUTION If the radius of the sphere is r, then its volume is V - 4 3 r 3 . If the error in the measured value of r is denoted by dr - Dr, then the corresponding error in the calculated value of V is DV , which can be approximated by the differential dV - 4r 2 dr When r - 21 and dr - 0.05, this becomes dV - 4s21d 2 0.05 < 277 The maximum error in the calculated volume is about 277 cm 3 . ■ Figure 6 shows the function in Exam- ple 3 and a comparison of dy and Dy when a - 2.

","256 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules NOTE Although the possible error in Example 4 may appear to be rather large, a better picture of the error is given by the relative error, which is computed by dividing the error by the total volume: DV V < dV V - 4r 2 dr 4 3 r 3 - 3 dr r Thus the relative error in the volume is about three times the relative error in the radius. In Example 4 the relative error in the radius is approximately dr yr - 0.05 y21 < 0.0024 and it produces a relative error of about 0.007 in the volume. The errors could also be expressed as percentage errors of 0.24% in the radius and 0.7% in the volume. 1–4 Find the linearization Ls xd of the function at a. 1. f s xd - x 3 2 x 2 1 3, a - 22 2. f s xd - sin x, a - y6 3. f s xd - sx , a - 4 4. f s xd - 2 x , a - 0 5.

","258 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules LABORATORY PROJECT ; TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS The tangent line approximation Ls xd is the best irst-degree (linear) approximation to f s xd near x - a because f s xd and Ls xd have the same rate of change (derivative) at a. For a better approximation than a linear one, let’s try a second-degree (quadratic) approximation Ps xd. In other words, we approximate a curve by a parabola instead of by a straight line. To make sure that the approximation is a good one, we stipulate the following: (i) Psad - f sad (P and f should have the same value at a.) (ii) P9 sad - f 9 sad (P and f should have the same rate of change at a.) (iii) P99sad - f 99 sad (The slopes of P and f should change at the same rate at a.) 1. Find the quadratic approximation Ps xd - A 1 Bx 1 Cx 2 to the function f s xd - cos x that satisies conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) with a - 0. Graph P, f , and the linear approximation Ls xd - 1 on a common screen. Comment on how well the functions P and L approximate f . 2. Determine the values of x for which the quadratic approximation f s xd< Ps xd in Problem 1 is accurate to within 0.1. [Hint: Graph y - Ps xd, y - cos x 2 0.1, and y - cos x 1 0.1 on a common screen.] 3. To approximate a function f by a quadratic function P near a number a, it is best to write P in the form Ps xd - A 1 Bs x 2 ad 1 Cs x 2 ad 2 Show that the quadratic function that satisies conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) is Ps xd - f sad 1 f 9 sads x 2 ad 1 1 2 f 99sads x 2 ad 2 4. Find the quadratic approximation to f s xd - sx 1 3 near a - 1. Graph f , the quadratic approximation, and the linear approximation from Example 3.10.2 on a common screen. What do you conclude? 5. Instead of being satisied with a linear or quadratic approximation to f s xd near x - a, let’s try to ind better approximations with higher-degree polynomials. We look for an nth-degree polynomial Tns xd - c0 1 c1s x 2 ad 1 c2s x 2 ad 2 1 c3s x 2 ad 3 1 ∙∙∙ 1 cns x 2 ad n such that Tn and its irst n derivatives have the same values at x - a as f and its irst n derivatives.

","SECTION 3.11 Hyperbolic Functions 259 Certain even and odd combinations of the exponential functions e x and e 2x arise so fre- quently in mathematics and its applications that they deserve to be given special names. In many ways they are analogous to the trigonometric functions, and they have the same relationship to the hyperbola that the trigonometric functions have to the circle. For this reason they are collectively called hyperbolic functions and individually called hyper- bolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, and so on. Deinition of the Hyperbolic Functions sinh x - e x 2 e 2x 2 csch x - 1 sinh x cosh x - e x 1 e 2x 2 sech x - 1 cosh x tanh x - sinh x cosh x coth x - cosh x sinh x The graphs of hyperbolic sine and cosine can be sketched using graphical addition as in Figures 1 and 2. y 0 x y=_1 y=1 1 2 y= ´ y=_ e–® 1 2 y=sinh x 0 y x y= e–® 1 2 1 2 y= ´ y=cosh x 1 0 y x FIGURE 1 y - sinh x - 1 2 e x 2 1 2 e 2x FIGURE 2 y - cosh x - 1 2 e x 1 1 2 e 2x FIGURE 3 y - tanh x Note that sinh has domain R and range R, while cosh has domain R and range f1, `d. The graph of tanh is shown in Figure 3. It has the horizontal asymptotes y - 61. (See Exercise 23.) Some of the mathematical uses of hyperbolic functions will be seen in Chapter 7. Applications to science and engineering occur whenever an entity such as light, velocity, electricity, or radioactivity is gradually absorbed or extinguished, for the decay can be represented by hyperbolic functions. The most famous application is the use of hyper- bolic cosine to describe the shape of a hanging wire. It can be proved that if a heavy lexible cable (such as a telephone or power line) is suspended between two points at the same height, then it takes the shape of a curve with equation y - c 1 a coshs x y ad called a catenary (see Figure 4).

","260 CHAPTER 3 Diferentiation Rules Another application of hyperbolic functions occurs in the description of ocean waves: The velocity of a water wave with length L moving across a body of water with depth d is modeled by the function v - Î tL 2 tanh S 2d L D where t is the acceleration due to gravity. (See Figure 5 and Exercise 49.) The hyperbolic functions satisfy a number of identities that are similar to well-known trigonometric identities. We list some of them here and leave most of the proofs to the exercises.

In fact, t can be interpreted as the radian measure of /POQ in Figure 6. For this reason the trigonometric functions are sometimes called circular functions.

","SECTION 3.11 Hyperbolic Functions 261 Likewise, if t is any real number, then the point Pscosh t, sinh td lies on the right branch of the hyperbola x 2 2 y 2 - 1 because cosh 2 t 2 sinh 2 t - 1 and cosh t > 1. This time, t does not represent the measure of an angle. However, it turns out that t represents twice the area of the shaded hyperbolic sector in Figure 7, just as in the trigonometric case t represents twice the area of the shaded circular sector in Figure 6. The derivatives of the hyperbolic functions are easily computed. For example, d dx ssinh xd - d dx S e x 2 e 2x 2 D - e x 1 e 2x 2 - cosh x We list the differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions as Table 1. The remain- ing proofs are left as exercises. Note the analogy with the differentiation formulas for trigonometric functions, but beware that the signs are different in some cases. 1 Derivatives of Hyperbolic Functions d dx ssinh xd - cosh x d dx scsch xd - 2csch x coth x d dx scosh xd - sinh x d dx ssech xd - 2sech x tanh x d dx stanh xd - sech 2 x d dx scoth xd - 2csch 2 x EXAMPLE 2 Any of these differentiation rules can be combined with the Chain Rule. For instance, d dx scosh sx d - sinh sx ? d dx sx - sinh sx 2 sx ■ Inverse Hyperbolic Functions You can see from Figures 1 and 3 that sinh and tanh are one-to-one functions and so they have inverse functions denoted by sinh 21 and tanh 21 . Figure 2 shows that cosh is not one- to-one, but when restricted to the domain f0, `d it becomes one-to-one. The inverse hyperbolic cosine function is deined as the inverse of this restricted function. 2 y - sinh 21 x &? sinh y - x y - cosh 21 x &? cosh y - x and y > 0 y - tanh 21 x &? tanh y - x The remaining inverse hyperbolic functions are deined similarly (see Exercise 28).

","270 Problems Plus Before you look at the examples, cover up the solutions and try them yourself irst. EXAMPLE 1 How many lines are tangent to both of the parabolas y - 21 2 x 2 and y - 1 1 x 2 ? Find the coordinates of the points at which these tangents touch the parabolas. SOLUTION To gain insight into this problem, it is essential to draw a diagram. So we sketch the parabolas y - 1 1 x 2 (which is the standard parabola y - x 2 shifted 1 unit upward) and y - 21 2 x 2 (which is obtained by relecting the irst parabola about the x-axis). If we try to draw a line tangent to both parabolas, we soon discover that there are only two possibilities, as illustrated in Figure 1. Let P be a point at which one of these tangents touches the upper parabola and let a be its x-coordinate. (The choice of notation for the unknown is important. Of course we could have used b or c or x 0 or x 1 instead of a. However, it’s not advisable to use x in place of a because that x could be confused with the variable x in the equation of the parabola.) Then, since P lies on the parabola y - 1 1 x 2 , its y-coordinate must be 1 1 a 2 . Because of the symmetry shown in Figure 1, the coordinates of the point Q where the tangent touches the lower parabola must be s2a, 2s1 1 a 2 dd. To use the given information that the line is a tangent, we equate the slope of the line PQ to the slope of the tangent line at P. We have m PQ - 1 1 a 2 2 s21 2 a 2 d a 2 s2ad - 1 1 a 2 a If f s xd - 1 1 x 2 , then the slope of the tangent line at P is f 9 sad - 2a. Thus the condi- tion that we need to use is that 1 1 a 2 a - 2a Solving this equation, we get 1 1 a 2 - 2a 2 , so a 2 - 1 and a - 61. Therefore the points are (1, 2) and s21, 22d . By symmetry, the two remaining points are s21, 2d and s1, 22d . ■ EXAMPLE 2 For what values of c does the equation ln x - cx 2 have exactly one solution? SOLUTION One of the most important principles of problem solving is to draw a dia- gram, even if the problem as stated doesn’t explicitly mention a geometric situation. Our present problem can be reformulated geometrically as follows: For what values of c does the curve y - ln x intersect the curve y - cx 2 in exactly one point? Let’s start by graphing y - ln x and y - cx 2 for various values of c. We know that, for c ± 0, y - cx 2 is a parabola that opens upward if c . 0 and downward if c , 0. Figure 2 shows the parabolas y - cx 2 for several positive values of c. Most of them don’t intersect y - ln x at all and one intersects twice. We have the feeling that there must be a value of c (somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3) for which the curves intersect exactly once, as in Figure 3. To ind that particular value of c, we let a be the x-coordinate of the single point of intersection. In other words, ln a - ca 2 , so a is the unique solution of the given equa- tion. We see from Figure 3 that the curves just touch, so they have a common tangent line when x - a. That means the curves y - ln x and y - cx 2 have the same slope when x - a. Therefore 1 a - 2ca x y P Q 1 _1 FIGURE 1 0 3≈ ≈ 0.3≈ 0.1≈ ≈ 1 2 x y y=ln x FIGURE 2 y=c≈ c=? y x 0 a y=ln x FIGURE 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

And let’s not forget about c - 0: The curve y - 0x 2 - 0 is just the x-axis, which intersects y - ln x exactly once. To summarize, the required values of c are c - 1 ys2ed and c < 0. ■ 1.

Applications of Differentiation 4 © Tatiana Makotra / Shutterstock.com WE HAVE ALREADY INVESTIGATED SOME of the applications of derivatives, but now that we know the differentiation rules we are in a better position to pursue the applications of differentia- tion in greater depth. Here we learn how derivatives affect the shape of a graph of a function and, in particular, how they help us locate maximum and minimum values of functions. Many practi- cal problems require us to minimize a cost or maximize an area or somehow ind the best possible outcome of a situation. In particular, we will be able to investigate the optimal shape of a can and to explain the location of rainbows in the sky. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","276 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation Some of the most important applications of differential calculus are optimization prob- lems, in which we are required to ind the optimal (best) way of doing something. Here are examples of such problems that we will solve in this chapter: • What is the shape of a can that minimizes manufacturing costs? • What is the maximum acceleration of a space shuttle? (This is an important question to the astronauts who have to withstand the effects of acceleration.) • What is the radius of a contracted windpipe that expels air most rapidly during a cough? • At what angle should blood vessels branch so as to minimize the energy expended by the heart in pumping blood? These problems can be reduced to inding the maximum or minimum values of a func- tion. Let’s irst explain exactly what we mean by maximum and minimum values. We see that the highest point on the graph of the function f shown in Figure 1 is the point s3, 5d. In other words, the largest value of f is f s3d - 5. Likewise, the smallest value is f s6d - 2. We say that f s3d - 5 is the absolute maximum of f and f s6d - 2 is the absolute minimum. In general, we use the following deinition. 1 Deinition Let c be a number in the domain D of a function f . Then f scd is the • absolute maximum value of f on D if f scd > f s xd for all x in D. • absolute minimum value of f on D if f scd < f s xd for all x in D. An absolute maximum or minimum is sometimes called a global maximum or mini- mum. The maximum and minimum values of f are called extreme values of f . Figure 2 shows the graph of a function f with absolute maximum at d and absolute minimum at a. Note that sd, f sd dd is the highest point on the graph and sa, f sadd is the lowest point. In Figure 2, if we consider only values of x near b [for instance, if we restrict our attention to the interval sa, cd], then f sbd is the largest of those values of f s xd and is called a local maximum value of f . Likewise, f scd is called a local minimum value of f because f scd < f s xd for x near c [in the interval sb, d d, for instance]. The function f also has a local minimum at e. In general, we have the following deinition. 2 Deinition The number f scd is a • local maximum value of f if f scd > f s xd when x is near c. • local minimum value of f if f scd < f s xd when x is near c. In Deinition 2 (and elsewhere), if we say that something is true near c, we mean that it is true on some open interval containing c. For instance, in Figure 3 we see that f s4d - 5 is a local minimum because it’s the smallest value of f on the interval I . It’s not the abso- lute minimum because f s xd takes smaller values when x is near 12 (in the interval K, for instance). In fact f s12d - 3 is both a local minimum and the absolute minimum. Similarly, f s8d - 7 is a local maximum, but not the absolute maximum because f takes larger values near 1.

Therefore f s0d - 0 is the absolute (and local) minimum value of f . This corresponds to the fact that the origin is the lowest point on the parabola y - x 2 . (See Figure 5.) However, there is no highest point on the parabola and so this function has no maximum value. ■ EXAMPLE 3 From the graph of the function f s xd - x 3 , shown in Figure 6, we see that this function has neither an absolute maximum value nor an absolute minimum value. In fact, it has no local extreme values either. ■ EXAMPLE 4 The graph of the function f s xd - 3x 4 2 16x 3 1 18x 2 21 < x < 4 is shown in Figure 7.

","278 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation 3 The Extreme Value Theorem If f is continuous on a closed interval fa, bg, then f attains an absolute maximum value f scd and an absolute minimum value f sd d at some numbers c and d in fa, bg. The Extreme Value Theorem is illustrated in Figure 8. Note that an extreme value can be taken on more than once. Although the Extreme Value Theorem is intuitively very plausible, it is dificult to prove and so we omit the proof. x y 0 b a c d x y 0 b a c¡ d c™ x y 0 d=b a c FIGURE 8 Functions continuous on a closed interval always attain extreme values. Figures 9 and 10 show that a function need not possess extreme values if either hypothesis (continuity or closed interval) is omitted from the Extreme Value Theorem. 1 x y 0 FIGURE 10 This continuous function g has no maximum or minimum. 2 1 x y 0 FIGURE 9 This function has minimum value f(2)=0, but no maximum value. 2 3 The function f whose graph is shown in Figure 9 is deined on the closed interval [0, 2] but has no maximum value. (Notice that the range of f is [0, 3). The function takes on values arbitrarily close to 3, but never actually attains the value 3.) This does not contradict the Extreme Value Theorem because f is not continuous. [Nonetheless, a discontinuous function could have maximum and minimum values. See Exercise 13(b).] The function t shown in Figure 10 is continuous on the open interval (0, 2) but has neither a maximum nor a minimum value. [The range of t is s1, `d. The function takes on arbitrarily large values.] This does not contradict the Extreme Value Theorem because the interval (0, 2) is not closed. The Extreme Value Theorem says that a continuous function on a closed interval has a maximum value and a minimum value, but it does not tell us how to find these extreme values. Notice in Figure 8 that the absolute maximum and minimum values that are between a and b occur at local maximum or minimum values, so we start by looking for local extreme values. Figure 11 shows the graph of a function f with a local maximum at c and a local minimum at d. It appears that at the maximum and minimum points the tangent lines are horizontal and therefore each has slope 0. We know that the derivative is the slope of the 0 x c d y {c, f (c)} {d, f (d )} FIGURE 11 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 4.1 Maximum and Minimum Values 279 tangent line, so it appears that f 9 scd - 0 and f 9 s d d - 0. The following theorem says that this is always true for differentiable functions. 4 Fermat’s Theorem If f has a local maximum or minimum at c, and if f 9 scd exists, then f 9 scd - 0. PROOF Suppose, for the sake of deiniteness, that f has a local maximum at c. Then, according to Deinition 2, f scd > f s xd if x is suficiently close to c. This implies that if h is suficiently close to 0, with h being positive or negative, then f scd > f sc 1 hd and therefore 5 f sc 1 hd 2 f scd < 0 We can divide both sides of an inequality by a positive number. Thus, if h . 0 and h is suficiently small, we have f sc 1 hd 2 f scd h < 0 Taking the right-hand limit of both sides of this inequality (using Theorem 2.3.2), we get lim hl0 1 f sc 1 hd 2 f scd h < lim h l0 1 0 - 0 But since f 9 scd exists, we have f 9 scd - lim h l0 f sc 1 hd 2 f scd h - lim h l0 1 f sc 1 hd 2 f scd h and so we have shown that f 9 scd < 0. If h , 0, then the direction of the inequality (5) is reversed when we divide by h: f sc 1 hd 2 f scd h > 0 h , 0 So, taking the left-hand limit, we have f 9 scd - lim h l0 f sc 1 hd 2 f scd h - lim h l0 2 f sc 1 hd 2 f scd h > 0 We have shown that f 9 scd > 0 and also that f 9 scd < 0. Since both of these inequalities must be true, the only possibility is that f 9 scd - 0. We have proved Fermat’s Theorem for the case of a local maximum. The case of a local minimum can be proved in a similar manner, or we could use Exercise 78 to deduce it from the case we have just proved (see Exercise 79). ■ The following examples caution us against reading too much into Fermat’s Theorem: We can’t expect to locate extreme values simply by setting f 9 s xd - 0 and solving for x. Fermat Fermat’s Theorem is named after Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), a French lawyer who took up mathematics as a hobby. Despite his amateur status, Fermat was one of the two inventors of analytic geometry (Descartes was the other). His methods for inding tangents to curves and maximum and minimum values (before the invention of limits and derivatives) made him a forerunner of Newton in the creation of diferential calculus.

","280 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation EXAMPLE 5 If f s xd - x 3 , then f 9 s xd - 3x 2 , so f 9 s0d - 0. But f has no maximum or minimum at 0, as you can see from its graph in Figure 12. (Or observe that x 3 . 0 for x . 0 but x 3 , 0 for x , 0.) The fact that f 9 s0d - 0 simply means that the curve y - x 3 has a horizontal tangent at s0, 0d. Instead of having a maximum or minimum at s0, 0d, the curve crosses its horizontal tangent there. ■ EXAMPLE 6 The function f s xd - | x | has its (local and absolute) minimum value at 0, but that value can’t be found by setting f 9 s xd - 0 because, as was shown in Example 2.8.5, f 9 s0d does not exist. (See Figure 13.) ■ WARNING Examples 5 and 6 show that we must be careful when using Fermat’s Theo- rem. Example 5 demonstrates that even when f 9 scd - 0 there need not be a maximum or minimum at c. (In other words, the converse of Fermat’s Theorem is false in gen- eral.) Furthermore, there may be an extreme value even when f 9 scd does not exist (as in Example 6). Fermat’s Theorem does suggest that we should at least start looking for extreme val- ues of f at the numbers c where f 9 scd - 0 or where f 9 scd does not exist. Such numbers are given a special name. 6 Deinition A critical number of a function f is a number c in the domain of f such that either f 9 scd - 0 or f 9 scd does not exist. EXAMPLE 7 Find the critical numbers of f s xd - x 3y5 s4 2 xd. SOLUTION The Product Rule gives f 9 s xd - x 3y5 s21d 1 s4 2 xd( 3 5 x 22y5 ) - 2x 3y5 1 3s4 2 xd 5x 2 y5 - 25x 1 3s4 2 xd 5x 2y5 - 12 2 8x 5x 2y5 [The same result could be obtained by irst writing f s xd - 4 x 3y5 2 x 8y5 .] Therefore f 9 s xd - 0 if 12 2 8x - 0, that is, x - 3 2 , and f 9 s xd does not exist when x - 0. Thus the critical numbers are 3 2 and 0. ■ In terms of critical numbers, Fermat’s Theorem can be rephrased as follows (compare Deinition 6 with Theorem 4): 7 If f has a local maximum or minimum at c, then c is a critical number of f . To ind an absolute maximum or minimum of a continuous function on a closed interval, we note that either it is local [in which case it occurs at a critical number by (7)] or it occurs at an endpoint of the interval, as we see from the examples in Figure 8. Thus the following three-step procedure always works. Figure 14 shows a graph of the function f in Example 7. It supports our answer because there is a horizontal tangent when x - 1.5 fwhere f 9s xd - 0g and a vertical tangent when x - 0 fwhere f 9s xd is undeinedg. 3.5 _2 _0.5 5 FIGURE 14 FIGURE 12 If f sxd - x 3 , then f 9s0d - 0, but f has no maximum or minimum. y=˛ x y 0 FIGURE 13 If f sxd - | x | , then f s0d - 0 is a minimum value, but f 9s0d does not exist. x 0 y=|x| y Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Find the values of f at the critical numbers of f in sa, bd. 2. Find the values of f at the endpoints of the interval. 3. The largest of the values from Steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value. EXAMPLE 8 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function f s xd - x 3 2 3x 2 1 1 2 1 2 < x < 4 SOLUTION Since f is continuous on f2 1 2 , 4g, we can use the Closed Interval Method: f s xd - x 3 2 3x 2 1 1 f 9 s xd - 3x 2 2 6x - 3x s x 2 2d Since f 9 s xd exists for all x, the only critical numbers of f occur when f 9 s xd - 0, that is, x - 0 or x - 2. Notice that each of these critical numbers lies in the interval s2 1 2 , 4d. The values of f at these critical numbers are f s0d - 1 f s2d - 23 The values of f at the endpoints of the interval are f s2 1 2 d - 1 8 f s4d - 17 Comparing these four numbers, we see that the absolute maximum value is f s4d - 17 and the absolute minimum value is f s2d - 23. Note that in this example the absolute maximum occurs at an endpoint, whereas the absolute minimum occurs at a critical number. The graph of f is sketched in Figure 15. ■ If you have a graphing calculator or a computer with graphing software, it is possible to estimate maximum and minimum values very easily. But, as the next example shows, calculus is needed to ind the exact values. EXAMPLE 9 (a) Use a graphing device to estimate the absolute minimum and maximum values of the function f s xd - x 2 2 sin x, 0 < x < 2. (b) Use calculus to ind the exact minimum and maximum values. SOLUTION (a) Figure 16 shows a graph of f in the viewing rectangle f0, 2g by f21, 8g. By moving the cursor close to the maximum point, we see that the y-coordinates don’t change very much in the vicinity of the maximum. The absolute maximum value is about 6.97 and it occurs when x < 5.2. Similarly, by moving the cursor close to the minimum point, we see that the absolute minimum value is about 20.68 and it occurs when x < 1.0.

A model for the velocity of the shuttle during this mission, from liftoff at t - 0 until the solid rocket boosters were jettisoned at t - 126 seconds, is given by vstd - 0.001302 t 3 2 0.09029 t 2 1 23.61t 2 3.083 (in feet per second). Using this model, estimate the absolute maximum and minimum values of the acceleration of the shuttle between liftoff and the jettisoning of the boosters. SOLUTION We are asked for the extreme values not of the given velocity function, but rather of the acceleration function. So we irst need to differentiate to ind the acceleration: astd - v9 std - d dt s0.001302t 3 2 0.09029t 2 1 23.61t 2 3.083d - 0.003906t 2 2 0.18058t 1 23.61 We now apply the Closed Interval Method to the continuous function a on the interval 0 < t < 126. Its derivative is a9 std - 0.007812t 2 0.18058 The only critical number occurs when a9 std - 0: t 1 - 0.18058 0.007812 < 23.12 Evaluating astd at the critical number and at the endpoints, we have as0d - 23.61 ast 1 d< 21.52 as126d< 62.87 So the maximum acceleration is about 62.87 ft y s 2 and the minimum acceleration is about 21.52 fty s 2 . ■ NASA Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

After the consumption of an alcoholic beverage, the concen- tration of alcohol in the bloodstream (blood alcohol concentra- tion, or BAC) surges as the alcohol is absorbed, followed by a gradual decline as the alcohol is metabolized.

When a foreign object lodged in the trachea (windpipe) forces a person to cough, the diaphragm thrusts upward causing an increase in pressure in the lungs. This is accompanied by a contraction of the trachea, making a narrower channel for the expelled air to low through. For a given amount of air to escape in a ixed time, it must move faster through the narrower channel than the wider one. The greater the velocity of the air- stream, the greater the force on the foreign object. X rays show that the radius of the circular tracheal tube contracts to about two-thirds of its normal radius during a cough. According to a mathematical model of coughing, the velocity v of the air- stream is related to the radius r of the trachea by the equation vsrd - ksr0 2 rdr 2 1 2 r0 < r < r0 where k is a constant and r0 is the normal radius of the trachea. The restriction on r is due to the fact that the tracheal wall stiffens under pressure and a contraction greater than 1 2 r0 is prevented (otherwise the person would suffocate).

They have fascinated mankind since ancient times and have inspired attempts at scientiic explanation since the time of Aristotle. In this project we use the ideas of Descartes and Newton to explain the shape, location, and colors of rainbows. 1. The igure shows a ray of sunlight entering a spherical raindrop at A. Some of the light is relected, but the line AB shows the path of the part that enters the drop. Notice that the light is refracted toward the normal line AO and in fact Snell’s Law says that sin  - k sin , where  is the angle of incidence,  is the angle of refraction, and k < 4 3 is the index of refraction for water. At B some of the light passes through the drop and is refracted into the air, but the line BC shows the part that is relected. (The angle of inci- dence equals the angle of relection.) When the ray reaches C, part of it is relected, but for the time being we are more interested in the part that leaves the raindrop at C. (Notice that it is refracted away from the normal line.) The angle of deviation Dsd is the amount of clockwise rotation that the ray has undergone during this three-stage process. Thus Dsd - s 2 d 1 s 2 2d 1 s 2 d -  1 2 2 4 Show that the minimum value of the deviation is Dsd< 1388 and occurs when  < 59.48 .

Draw the causal diagram that corresponds to the initial expectationt. 2. Suppose. 3. Suppose. THE PARADOX The signiicance of the minimum deviation is that when  < 59.48 we have D9 sd< 0, so DD yD < 0. This means that many rays with  < 59.48 become deviated by approxi- mately the same amount. It is the concentration of rays coming from near the direction of minimum deviation that creates the brightness of the primary rainbow. The igure at the left shows that the angle of elevation from the observer up to the highest point on the rainbow is 180 82 1388 - 428 . (This angle is called the rainbow angle.) 2. Problem 1 explains the location of the primary rainbow, but how do we explain the colors? Sunlight comprises a range of wavelengths, from the red range through orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. As Newton discovered in his prism experiments of 1666, the index of refraction is different for each color. (The effect is called dispersion.) For red light the refractive index is k < 1.3318, whereas for violet light it is k < 1.3435. By repeating the calculation of Problem 1 for these values of k, show that the rainbow angle is about 42.38 for the red bow and 40.68 for the violet bow. So the rainbow really consists of seven individual bows corresponding to the seven colors. 3. Perhaps you have seen a fainter secondary rainbow above the primary bow. That results from the part of a ray that enters a raindrop and is refracted at A, relected twice (at B and C), and refracted as it leaves the drop at D (see the igure at the left). This time the devia- tion angle Dsd is the total amount of counterclockwise rotation that the ray undergoes in this four-stage process. Show that Dsd - 2 2 6 1 2 and Dsd has a minimum value when cos  - Î k 2 2 1 8 Taking k - 4 3 , show that the minimum deviation is about 1298 and so the rainbow angle for the secondary rainbow is about 51 8 , as shown in the igure at the left. 4.

","SECTION 4.2 The Mean Value Theorem 287 We will see that many of the results of this chapter depend on one central fact, which is called the Mean Value Theorem. But to arrive at the Mean Value Theorem we irst need the following result. Rolle’s Theorem Let f be a function that satisies the following three hypotheses: 1. f is continuous on the closed interval fa, bg. 2. f is differentiable on the open interval sa, bd. 3. f sad - f sbd Then there is a number c in sa, bd such that f 9 scd - 0. Rolle Rolle’s Theorem was irst published in 1691 by the French mathematician Michel Rolle (1652–1719) in a book entitled Méthode pour resoudre les Egalitez. He was a vocal critic of the methods of his day and attacked calcu- lus as being a “collection of ingenious fallacies.” Later, however, he became convinced of the essential correctness of the methods of calculus. Before giving the proof let’s take a look at the graphs of some typical functions that satisfy the three hypotheses. Figure 1 shows the graphs of four such functions. In each case it appears that there is at least one point sc, f scdd on the graph where the tangent is horizontal and therefore f 9 scd - 0. Thus Rolle’s Theorem is plausible. (b) a c b x y 0 (c) b a c¡ c™ x y 0 (d) b a c y x 0 (a) b a c¡ c™ x y 0 PROOF There are three cases: CASE I f s xd - k, a constant Then f 9 s xd - 0, so the number c can be taken to be any number in sa, bd. CASE II f s xd . f s ad for some x in sa, bd [as in Figure 1(b) or (c)] By the Extreme Value Theorem (which we can apply by hypothesis 1), f has a maxi- mum value somewhere in fa, bg. Since f sad - f sbd, it must attain this maximum value at a number c in the open interval sa, bd. Then f has a local maximum at c and, by hypothesis 2, f is differentiable at c. Therefore f 9 scd - 0 by Fermat’s Theorem. CASE III f s xd , f s ad for some x in sa, bd [as in Figure 1(c) or (d)] By the Extreme Value Theorem, f has a minimum value in fa, bg and, since f sad - f sbd, it attains this minimum value at a number c in sa, bd. Again f 9 scd - 0 by Fermat’s Theorem. ■ EXAMPLE 1 Let’s apply Rolle’s Theorem to the position function s - f s t d of a moving object. If the object is in the same place at two different instants t - a and t - b, then f sad - f sbd. Rolle’s Theorem says that there is some instant of time t - c between a and b when f 9 scd - 0; that is, the velocity is 0. (In particular, you can see that this is true when a ball is thrown directly upward.) ■ EXAMPLE 2 Prove that the equation x 3 1 x 2 1 - 0 has exactly one real root. SOLUTION First we use the Intermediate Value Theorem (2.5.10) to show that a root exists. Let f s xd - x 3 1 x 2 1. Then f s0d - 21 , 0 and f s1d - 1 . 0.

","288 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation polynomial, it is continuous, so the Intermediate Value Theorem states that there is a number c between 0 and 1 such that f scd - 0. Thus the given equation has a root. To show that the equation has no other real root, we use Rolle’s Theorem and argue by contradiction. Suppose that it had two roots a and b. Then f sad - 0 - f sbd and, since f is a polynomial, it is differentiable on sa, bd and continuous on fa, bg. Thus, by Rolle’s Theorem, there is a number c between a and b such that f 9 scd - 0. But f 9 s xd - 3x 2 1 1 > 1 for all x (since x 2 > 0) so f 9 s xd can never be 0. This gives a contradiction. Therefore the equa- tion can’t have two real roots. ■ Our main use of Rolle’s Theorem is in proving the following important theorem, which was first stated by another French mathematician, Joseph-Louis Lagrange. The Mean Value Theorem Let f be a function that satisfies the following hypotheses: 1. f is continuous on the closed interval fa, bg. 2. f is differentiable on the open interval sa, bd. Then there is a number c in sa, bd such that 1 f 9 scd - f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a or, equivalently, 2 f sbd 2 f sad - f 9 scdsb 2 ad The Mean Value Theorem is an example of what is called an existence theorem. Like the Intermediate Value Theorem, the Extreme Value Theorem, and Rolle’s Theorem, it guarantees that there exists a number with a certain property, but it doesn’t tell us how to find the number. Before proving this theorem, we can see that it is reasonable by interpreting it geomet- rically. Figures 3 and 4 show the points Asa, f sadd and Bsb, f sbdd on the graphs of two differentiable functions. The slope of the secant line AB is 3 m AB - f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a which is the same expression as on the right side of Equation 1. Since f 9 scd is the slope of the tangent line at the point sc, f scdd, the Mean Value Theorem, in the form given by Equa- tion 1, says that there is at least one point Psc, f scdd on the graph where the slope of the tangent line is the same as the slope of the secant line AB. In other words, there is a point P where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line AB. (Imagine a line far away that stays parallel to AB while moving toward AB until it touches the graph for the first time.) 0 x y a c b B{b, f(b)} P{c, f(c)} A{a, f(a)} 0 x y c¡ c™ B P¡ A P™ b a FIGURE 3 FIGURE 4 Figure 2 shows a graph of the func- tion f s xd - x 3 1 x 2 1 discussed in Example 2.

","SECTION 4.2 The Mean Value Theorem 289 PROOF We apply Rolle’s Theorem to a new function h deined as the difference between f and the function whose graph is the secant line AB. Using Equation 3 and the point-slope equation of a line, we see that the equation of the line AB can be written as y 2 f sad - f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a s x 2 ad or as y - f sad 1 f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a s x 2 ad So, as shown in Figure 5, 4 hs xd - f s xd 2 f sad 2 f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a s x 2 ad First we must verify that h satisies the three hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem. 1. The function h is continuous on fa, bg because it is the sum of f and a irst-degree polynomial, both of which are continuous. 2. The function h is differentiable on sa, bd because both f and the irst-degree poly- nomial are differentiable. In fact, we can compute h9 directly from Equation 4: h9 s xd - f 9 s xd 2 f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a (Note that f sad and f f sbd 2 f sadgysb 2 ad are constants.) 3. hsad - f sad 2 f sad 2 f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a sa 2 ad - 0 hsbd - f sbd 2 f sad 2 f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a sb 2 ad - f sbd 2 f sad 2 f f sbd 2 f sadg - 0 Therefore hsad - hsbd. Since h satisies the hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem, that theorem says there is a num- ber c in sa, bd such that h9 scd - 0. Therefore 0 - h9 scd - f 9 scd 2 f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a and so f 9 scd - f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a ■ EXAMPLE 3 To illustrate the Mean Value Theorem with a speciic function, let’s consider f s xd - x 3 2 x, a - 0, b - 2. Since f is a polynomial, it is continuous and differentiable for all x, so it is certainly continuous on f0, 2g and differentiable on s0, 2d . Therefore, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number c in s0, 2d such that f s2d 2 f s0d - f 9 scds2 2 0d Now f s2d - 6, f s0d - 0, and f 9 s xd - 3x 2 2 1, so this equation becomes 6 - s3c 2 2 1d2 - 6c 2 2 2 which gives c 2 - 4 3 , that is, c - 62ys3 .

He was a child prodigy and became a professor in Turin at the tender age of 19. Lagrange made great contributions to number theory, theory of functions, theory of equations, and analytical and celestial mechanics. In particular, he applied calculus to the analysis of the stability of the solar system. At the invitation of Frederick the Great, he succeeded Euler at the Berlin Academy and, when Frederick died, Lagrange accepted King Louis XVI’s invitation to Paris, where he was given apartments in the Louvre and became a professor at the Ecole Polytechnique. Despite all the trappings of luxury and fame, he was a kind and quiet man, living only for science. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","290 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation Figure 6 illustrates this calculation: The tangent line at this value of c is parallel to the secant line OB. ■ EXAMPLE 4 If an object moves in a straight line with position function s - f s t d, then the average velocity between t - a and t - b is f sbd 2 f sad b 2 a and the velocity at t - c is f 9 scd. Thus the Mean Value Theorem (in the form of Equa- tion 1) tells us that at some time t - c between a and b the instantaneous velocity f 9 scd is equal to that average velocity. For instance, if a car traveled 180 km in 2 hours, then the speedometer must have read 90 kmyh at least once. In general, the Mean Value Theorem can be interpreted as saying that there is a number at which the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the average rate of change over an interval. ■ The main signiicance of the Mean Value Theorem is that it enables us to obtain infor- mation about a function from information about its derivative. The next example pro- vides an instance of this principle. EXAMPLE 5 Suppose that f s0d - 23 and f 9 s xd < 5 for all values of x. How large can f s2d possibly be? SOLUTION We are given that f is differentiable (and therefore continuous) everywhere. In particular, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem on the interval f0, 2g. There exists a number c such that f s2d 2 f s0d - f 9 scds2 2 0d so f s2d - f s0d 1 2 f 9 scd - 23 1 2 f 9 scd We are given that f 9 s xd < 5 for all x, so in particular we know that f 9 scd < 5. Multiply- ing both sides of this inequality by 2, we have 2 f 9 scd < 10, so f s2d - 23 1 2 f 9 scd <23 1 10 - 7 The largest possible value for f s2d is 7. ■ The Mean Value Theorem can be used to establish some of the basic facts of differ- ential calculus. One of these basic facts is the following theorem. Others will be found in the following sections. 5 Theorem If f 9 s xd - 0 for all x in an interval sa, bd, then f is constant on sa, bd . PROOF Let x 1 and x 2 be any two numbers in sa, bd with x 1 , x 2 . Since f is differen- tiable on sa, bd, it must be differentiable on s x 1 , x 2 d and continuous on fx 1 , x 2 g. By applying the Mean Value Theorem to f on the interval fx 1 , x 2 g, we get a number c such that x 1 , c , x 2 and 6 f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d - f 9 scds x 2 2 x 1 d Since f 9 s xd - 0 for all x, we have f 9 scd - 0, and so Equation 6 becomes f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d - 0 or f s x 2 d - f s x 1 d FIGURE 6 y=˛- x B x y c 2 O Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 4.2 The Mean Value Theorem 291 Therefore f has the same value at any two numbers x 1 and x 2 in sa, bd. This means that f is constant on sa, bd. ■ 7 Corollary If f 9 s xd - t9 s xd for all x in an interval sa, bd, then f 2 t is constant on sa, bd; that is, f s xd - ts xd 1 c where c is a constant. PROOF Let Fs xd - f s xd 2 ts xd. Then F9 s xd - f 9 s xd 2 t9 s xd - 0 for all x in sa, bd. Thus, by Theorem 5, F is constant; that is, f 2 t is constant. ■ NOTE Care must be taken in applying Theorem 5. Let f s xd - x | x | - H 1 21 if x . 0 if x , 0 The domain of f is D - h x | x ± 0j and f 9 s xd - 0 for all x in D. But f is obviously not a constant function. This does not contradict Theorem 5 because D is not an interval. Notice that f is constant on the interval s0, `d and also on the interval s2`, 0d. EXAMPLE 6 Prove the identity tan 21 x 1 cot 21 x - y2. SOLUTION Although calculus isn’t needed to prove this identity, the proof using calcu- lus is quite simple. If f s xd - tan 21 x 1 cot 21 x, then f 9 s xd - 1 1 1 x 2 2 1 1 1 x 2 - 0 for all values of x. Therefore f s xd - C, a constant.

","SECTION 4.3 How Derivatives Afect the Shape of a Graph 293 Many of the applications of calculus depend on our ability to deduce facts about a func- tion f from information concerning its derivatives. Because f 9 s xd represents the slope of the curve y - f s xd at the point s x, f s xdd, it tells us the direction in which the curve pro- ceeds at each point. So it is reasonable to expect that information about f 9 s xd will provide us with information about f s xd. What Does f 9 Say About f ? To see how the derivative of f can tell us where a function is increasing or decreasing, look at Figure 1. (Increasing functions and decreasing functions were deined in Section 1.1.) Between A and B and between C and D, the tangent lines have positive slope and so f 9 s xd . 0. Between B and C, the tangent lines have negative slope and so f 9 s xd , 0. Thus it appears that f increases when f 9 s xd is positive and decreases when f 9 s xd is nega- tive. To prove that this is always the case, we use the Mean Value Theorem. Increasing/Decreasing Test (a) If f 9 s xd . 0 on an interval, then f is increasing on that interval. (b) If f 9 s xd , 0 on an interval, then f is decreasing on that interval. Let’s abbreviate the name of this test to the I/D Test. PROOF (a) Let x 1 and x 2 be any two numbers in the interval with x 1 , x 2 . According to the deinition of an increasing function (page 19), we have to show that f s x 1 d , f s x 2 d. Because we are given that f 9 s xd . 0, we know that f is differentiable on f x 1 , x 2 g. So, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number c between x 1 and x 2 such that 1 f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d - f 9 scds x 2 2 x 1 d Now f 9 scd . 0 by assumption and x 2 2 x 1 . 0 because x 1 , x 2 . Thus the right side of Equation 1 is positive, and so f s x 2 d 2 f s x 1 d . 0 or f s x 1 d , f s x 2 d This shows that f is increasing. Part (b) is proved similarly. ■ EXAMPLE 1 Find where the function f s xd - 3x 4 2 4x 3 2 12x 2 1 5 is increasing and where it is decreasing. SOLUTION We start by differentiating f : f 9 s xd - 12x 3 2 12x 2 2 24x - 12x s x 2 2ds x 1 1d To use the IyD Test we have to know where f 9 s xd . 0 and where f 9 s xd , 0. To solve these inequalities we irst ind where f 9s xd - 0, namely at x - 0, 2, and 21. These are the critical numbers of f , and they divide the domain into four intervals (see the number line at the left). Within each interval, f 9s xd must be always posi- tive or always negative. (See Examples 3 and 4 in Appendix A.) We can determine which is the case for each interval from the signs of the three factors of f 9s xd, namely, 12x, x 2 2, and x 1 1, as shown in the following chart. A plus sign indicates that the given expression is positive, and a minus sign indicates that it is negative. The last col- 0 _1 2 x D A B C y 0 x FIGURE 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","294 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation umn of the chart gives the conclusion based on the IyD Test. For instance, f 9 s xd , 0 for 0 , x , 2, so f is decreasing on (0, 2).

We therefore need a test that will tell us whether or not f has a local maximum or minimum at a critical number. You can see from Figure 2 that f s0d - 5 is a local maximum value of f because f increases on s21, 0d and decreases on s0, 2d. Or, in terms of derivatives, f 9 s xd . 0 for 21 , x , 0 and f 9 s xd , 0 for 0 , x , 2. In other words, the sign of f 9 s xd changes from positive to negative at 0. This observation is the basis of the following test. The First Derivative Test Suppose that c is a critical number of a continuous function f . (a) If f 9 changes from positive to negative at c, then f has a local maximum at c. (b) If f 9 changes from negative to positive at c, then f has a local minimum at c. (c) If f 9 is positive to the left and right of c, or negative to the left and right of c, then f has no local maximum or minimum at c. The First Derivative Test is a consequence of the IyD Test. In part (a), for instance, since the sign of f 9 s xd changes from positive to negative at c, f is increasing to the left of c and decreasing to the right of c. It follows that f has a local maximum at c. It is easy to remember the First Derivative Test by visualizing diagrams such as those in Figure 3. 0 x y c fª(x)>0 fª(x)<0 (a) Local maximum c 0 x y fª(x)<0 fª(x)<0 (d) No maximum or minimum (c) No maximum or minimum c 0 x y fª(x)>0 fª(x)>0 c 0 x y fª(x)<0 fª(x)>0 (b) Local minimum EXAMPLE 2 Find the local minimum and maximum values of the function f in Example 1. 20 _30 _2 3 FIGURE 2 FIGURE 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 4.3 How Derivatives Afect the Shape of a Graph 295 SOLUTION From the chart in the solution to Example 1 we see that f 9 s xd changes from negative to positive at 21, so f s21d - 0 is a local minimum value by the First Deriva- tive Test. Similarly, f 9 changes from negative to positive at 2, so f s2d - 227 is also a local minimum value. As noted previously, f s0d - 5 is a local maximum value because f 9 s xd changes from positive to negative at 0. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Find the local maximum and minimum values of the function ts xd - x 1 2 sin x 0 < x < 2 SOLUTION As in Example 1, we start by inding the critical numbers. The derivative is: t9 s xd - 1 1 2 cos x so t9 s xd - 0 when cos x - 2 1 2 . The solutions of this equation are 2y3 and 4y3. Because t is differentiable everywhere, the only critical numbers are 2y3 and 4y3. We split the domain into intervals according to the critical numbers. Within each interval, t9 s xd is either always positive or always negative and so we analyze t in the following chart. Interval t9 s xd - 1 1 2 cos x t 0 , x , 2y3 1 increasing on s0, 2y3d 2y3 , x , 4y3 2 decreasing on s2y3, 4y3d 4y3 , x , 2 1 increasing on s4y3, 2d Because t9 s xd changes from positive to negative at 2y3, the First Derivative Test tells us that there is a local maximum at 2y3 and the local maximum value is ts2y3d - 2 3 1 2 sin 2 3 - 2 3 1 2 S s3 2 D - 2 3 1 s3 < 3.83 Likewise, t9 s xd changes from negative to positive at 4y3 and so ts4y3d - 4 3 1 2 sin 4 3 - 4 3 1 2 S 2 s3 2 D - 4 3 2 s3 < 2.46 is a local minimum value. The graph of t in Figure 4 supports our conclusion. ■ What Does f 99 Say About f ? Figure 5 shows the graphs of two increasing functions on sa, bd.

","296 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation In Figure 6 tangents to these curves have been drawn at several points. In (a) the curve lies above the tangents and f is called concave upward on sa, bd. In (b) the curve lies below the tangents and t is called concave downward on sa, bd. Deinition If the graph of f lies above all of its tangents on an interval I, then it is called concave upward on I. If the graph of f lies below all of its tangents on I, it is called concave downward on I. Figure 7 shows the graph of a function that is concave upward (abbreviated CU) on the intervals sb, cd, sd, ed, and se, pd and concave downward (CD) on the intervals sa, bd , sc, d d, and s p, qd. a b c d e p q B C D P x y 0 CD CU CD CU CD CU FIGURE 7 Let’s see how the second derivative helps determine the intervals of concavity. Look- ing at Figure 6(a), you can see that, going from left to right, the slope of the tangent increases. This means that the derivative f 9 is an increasing function and therefore its derivative f 0 is positive. Likewise, in Figure 6(b) the slope of the tangent decreases from left to right, so f 9 decreases and therefore f 0 is negative. This reasoning can be reversed and suggests that the following theorem is true. A proof is given in Appendix F with the help of the Mean Value Theorem. Concavity Test (a) If f 0s xd . 0 for all x in I, then the graph of f is concave upward on I. (b) If f 0s xd , 0 for all x in I, then the graph of f is concave downward on I. EXAMPLE 4 Figure 8 shows a population graph for Cyprian honeybees raised in an apiary. How does the rate of population increase change over time? When is this rate highest? Over what intervals is P concave upward or concave downward? t P 3 20 0 Time (in weeks) 6 9 12 15 40 60 80 Number of bees (in thousands) 18 g A B x y 0 f A B x y 0 (a) Concave upward (b) Concave downward FIGURE 6 FIGURE 8 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 4.3 How Derivatives Afect the Shape of a Graph 297 SOLUTION By looking at the slope of the curve as t increases, we see that the rate of increase of the population is initially very small, then gets larger until it reaches a maximum at about t - 12 weeks, and decreases as the population begins to level off. As the population approaches its maximum value of about 75,000 (called the carrying capacity), the rate of increase, P9 std, approaches 0. The curve appears to be concave upward on (0, 12) and concave downward on (12, 18). ■ In Example 4, the population curve changed from concave upward to concave down- ward at approximately the point (12, 38,000). This point is called an inlection point of the curve. The signiicance of this point is that the rate of population increase has its maximum value there. In general, an inlection point is a point where a curve changes its direction of concavity. Deinition A point P on a curve y - f s xd is called an inlection point if f is con- tinuous there and the curve changes from concave upward to concave downward or from concave downward to concave upward at P. For instance, in Figure 7, B, C, D, and P are the points of inlection. Notice that if a curve has a tangent at a point of inlection, then the curve crosses its tangent there. In view of the Concavity Test, there is a point of inlection at any point where the second derivative changes sign. EXAMPLE 5 Sketch a possible graph of a function f that satisies the following conditions: sid f 9 s xd . 0 on s2`, 1d, f 9 s xd , 0 on s1, `d siid f 0s xd . 0 on s2`, 22d and s2, `d, f 0s xd , 0 on s22, 2d siiid lim x l2` f s xd - 22, lim x l` f s xd - 0 SOLUTION Condition (i) tells us that f is increasing on s2`, 1d and decreasing on s1, `d. Condition (ii) says that f is concave upward on s2`, 22d and s2, `d, and con- cave downward on s22, 2d. From condition (iii) we know that the graph of f has two horizontal asymptotes: y - 22 (to the left) and y - 0 (to the right). We irst draw the horizontal asymptote y - 22 as a dashed line (see Figure 9). We then draw the graph of f approaching this asymptote at the far left, increasing to its maximum point at x - 1, and decreasing toward the x-axis as at the far right. We also make sure that the graph has inlection points when x - 22 and 2. Notice that we made the curve bend upward for x ,22 and x . 2, and bend downward when x is between 22 and 2. ■ Another application of the second derivative is the following test for identifying local maximum and minimum values. It is a consequence of the Concavity Test, and serves as an alternative to the First Derivative Test. The Second Derivative Test Suppose f 0 is continuous near c. (a) If f 9 scd - 0 and f 0scd . 0, then f has a local minimum at c. (b) If f 9 scd - 0 and f 0scd , 0, then f has a local maximum at c. For instance, part (a) is true because f 0s xd . 0 near c and so f is concave upward near c. This means that the graph of f lies above its horizontal tangent at c and so f has a local minimum at c.

","298 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation EXAMPLE 6 Discuss the curve y - x 4 2 4x 3 with respect to concavity, points of inlection, and local maxima and minima. Use this information to sketch the curve. SOLUTION If f s xd - x 4 2 4x 3 , then f 9 s xd - 4x 3 2 12x 2 - 4x 2 s x 2 3d f 0s xd - 12x 2 2 24x - 12x s x 2 2d To ind the critical numbers we set f 9 s xd - 0 and obtain x - 0 and x - 3. (Note that f 9 is a polynomial and hence deined everywhere.) To use the Second Derivative Test we evaluate f 0 at these critical numbers: f 0s0d - 0 f 0s3d - 36 . 0 Since f 9 s3d - 0 and f 0s3d . 0, f s3d - 227 is a local minimum. [In fact, the expres- sion for f 9 s xd shows that f decreases to the left of 3 and increases to the right of 3.] Since f 0s0d - 0, the Second Derivative Test gives no information about the critical number 0. But since f 9 s xd , 0 for x , 0 and also for 0 , x , 3, the First Derivative Test tells us that f does not have a local maximum or minimum at 0. Since f 0s xd - 0 when x - 0 or 2, we divide the real line into intervals with these numbers as endpoints and complete the following chart. Interval f 99 s xd - 12 x s x 2 2d Concavity s2`, 0d 1 upward s0, 2d 2 downward s2, `d 1 upward The point s0, 0d is an inlection point since the curve changes from concave upward to concave downward there. Also s2, 216d is an inlection point since the curve changes from concave downward to concave upward there. Using the local minimum, the intervals of concavity, and the inlection points, we sketch the curve in Figure 11. ■ NOTE The Second Derivative Test is inconclusive when f 0scd - 0. In other words, at such a point there might be a maximum, there might be a minimum, or there might be neither (as in Example 6). This test also fails when f 0scd does not exist. In such cases the First Derivative Test must be used. In fact, even when both tests apply, the First Deriva- tive Test is often the easier one to use. EXAMPLE 7 Sketch the graph of the function f s xd - x 2y3 s6 2 xd 1y3 .

","SECTION 4.3 How Derivatives Afect the Shape of a Graph 299 Interval 4 2 x x 1 y3 s6 2 xd 2y3 f 9 s xd f x , 0 1 2 1 2 decreasing on s2`, 0d 0 , x , 4 1 1 1 1 increasing on s0, 4d 4 , x , 6 2 1 1 2 decreasing on s4, 6d x . 6 2 1 1 2 decreasing on s6, `d To ind the local extreme values we use the First Derivative Test. Since f 9 changes from negative to positive at 0, f s0d - 0 is a local minimum. Since f 9 changes from pos- itive to negative at 4, f s4d - 2 5y3 is a local maximum. The sign of f 9 does not change at 6, so there is no minimum or maximum there. (The Second Derivative Test could be used at 4 but not at 0 or 6 since f 0 does not exist at either of these numbers.) Looking at the expression for f 0s xd and noting that x 4y3 > 0 for all x, we have f 0s xd , 0 for x , 0 and for 0 , x , 6 and f 0s xd . 0 for x . 6. So f is concave downward on s2`, 0d and s0, 6d and concave upward on s6, `d, and the only inlec- tion point is s6, 0d. The graph is sketched in Figure 12. Note that the curve has vertical tangents at s0, 0d and s6, 0d because | f 9 s xd | l ` as x l 0 and as x l 6. ■ EXAMPLE 8 Use the irst and second derivatives of f s xd - e 1yx , together with asymp- totes, to sketch its graph. SOLUTION Notice that the domain of f is h x | x ± 0j, so we check for vertical asymptotes by computing the left and right limits as x l 0. As x l 0 1 , we know that t - 1 yx l `, so lim xl 0 1 e 1yx - lim tl ` e t - ` and this shows that x - 0 is a vertical asymptote. As x l 0 2 , we have t - 1 yx l 2`, so lim xl 0 2 e 1yx - lim tl2` e t - 0 As x l 6`, we have 1 yx l 0 and so lim xl6` e 1yx - e 0 - 1 This shows that y - 1 is a horizontal asymptote (both to the left and right). Now let’s compute the derivative. The Chain Rule gives f 9 s xd - 2 e 1yx x 2 Since e 1yx . 0 and x 2 . 0 for all x ± 0, we have f 9 s xd , 0 for all x ± 0. Thus f is decreasing on s2`, 0d and on s0, `d. There is no critical number, so the function has no local maximum or minimum. The second derivative is f 0s xd - 2 x 2 e 1yx s21 yx 2 d 2 e 1yx s2xd x 4 - e 1yx s2x 1 1d x 4 Since e 1yx . 0 and x 4 . 0, we have f 0s xd . 0 when x .2 1 2 sx ± 0d and f 0s xd , 0 when x ,2 1 2 . So the curve is concave downward on s2`, 2 1 2 d and concave upward on s2 1 2 , 0d and on s0, `d. The inlection point is s2 1 2 , e 22 d.

","304 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation Suppose we are trying to analyze the behavior of the function Fs xd - ln x x 2 1 Although F is not deined when x - 1, we need to know how F behaves near 1. In par- ticular, we would like to know the value of the limit lim x l1 ln x x 2 1 In computing this limit we can’t apply Law 5 of limits (the limit of a quotient is the quo tient of the limits, see Section 2.3) because the limit of the denominator is 0. In fact, although the limit in (1) exists, its value is not obvious because both numerator and denominator approach 0 and 0 0 is not defined. In general, if we have a limit of the form lim x l a f s xd ts xd where both f s xd l 0 and ts xd l 0 as x l a, then this limit may or may not exist and is called an indeterminate form of type 0 0 . We met some limits of this type in Chapter 2. For rational functions, we can cancel common factors: lim x l1 x 2 2 x x 2 2 1 - lim x l1 x s x 2 1d s x 1 1ds x 2 1d - lim x l1 x x 1 1 - 1 2 1 90. Suppose that f 09 is continuous and f 9 scd - f 0scd - 0, but f -scd . 0. Does f have a local maximum or minimum at c? Does f have a point of inlection at c? 91. Suppose f is differentiable on an interval I and f 9s xd . 0 for all numbers x in I except for a single number c. Prove that f is increasing on the entire interval I . 92. For what values of c is the function f s xd - cx 1 1 x 2 1 3 increasing on s2`, `d? 93. The three cases in the First Derivative Test cover the situa- tions one commonly encounters but do not exhaust all pos- sibilities. Consider the functions f, t, and h whose values at 0 are all 0 and, for x ± 0, f s xd - x 4 sin 1 x t sxd - x 4 S 2 1 sin 1 x D hs xd - x 4 S 22 1 sin 1 x D (a) Show that 0 is a critical number of all three functions but their derivatives change sign ininitely often on both sides of 0.

Show that a cubic function (a third-degree polynomial) always has exactly one point of inlection. If its graph has three x-intercepts x 1, x 2, and x 3, show that the x-coordinate of the inlection point is s x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 dy3. 86.

","305 SECTION 4.4 Indeterminate Forms and l’Hospital’s Rule 305 We used a geometric argument to show that lim x l 0 sin x x - 1 But these methods do not work for limits such as (1), so in this section we introduce a systematic method, known as l’Hospital’s Rule, for the evaluation of indeterminate forms. Another situation in which a limit is not obvious occurs when we look for a horizontal asymptote of F and need to evaluate the limit lim x l ` ln x x 2 1 It isn’t obvious how to evaluate this limit because both numerator and denominator become large as x l `. There is a struggle between numerator and denominator. If the numerator wins, the limit will be ` (the numerator was increasing signiicantly faster than the denominator); if the denominator wins, the answer will be 0. Or there may be some compromise, in which case the answer will be some inite positive number. In general, if we have a limit of the form lim x l a f s xd ts xd where both f s xd l ` (or 2`) and ts xd l ` (or 2`), then the limit may or may not exist and is called an indeterminate form of type ` y `. We saw in Section 2.6 that this type of limit can be evaluated for certain functions, including rational functions, by dividing numerator and denominator by the highest power of x that occurs in the denom- inator. For instance, lim x l ` x 2 2 1 2x 2 1 1 - lim x l ` 1 2 1 x 2 2 1 1 x 2 - 1 2 0 2 1 0 - 1 2 This method does not work for limits such as (2), but l’Hospital’s Rule also applies to this type of indeterminate form. L’Hospital’s Rule Suppose f and t are differentiable and t9 s xd ± 0 on an open interval I that contains a (except possibly at a). Suppose that lim x la f s xd - 0 and lim x la ts xd - 0 or that lim x la f s xd - 6` and lim x la ts xd - 6` (In other words, we have an indeterminate form of type 0 0 or ` y`.) Then lim x l a f s xd ts xd - lim x l a f 9 s xd t9 s xd if the limit on the right side exists (or is ` or 2`). NOTE 1 L’Hospital’s Rule says that the limit of a quotient of functions is equal to the limit of the quotient of their derivatives, provided that the given conditions are satisied. 2 Figure 1 suggests visually why l’Hospital’s Rule might be true. The irst graph shows two differentiable functions f and t, each of which approaches 0 as x l a. If we were to zoom in toward the point sa, 0d, the graphs would start to look almost linear. But if the functions actually were linear, as in the second graph, then their ratio would be m1s x 2 ad m2s x 2 ad - m1 m2 which is the ratio of their deriva- tives. This suggests that lim x la f s xd t s xd - lim x la f 9 s xd t9 s xd FIGURE 1 0 y x a y=m¡(x-a) y=m™(x-a) 0 y x a f g Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","306 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation 306 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation It is especially important to verify the conditions regarding the limits of f and t before using l’Hospital’s Rule. NOTE 2 L’Hospital’s Rule is also valid for one-sided limits and for limits at ininity or negative ininity; that is, “x l a” can be replaced by any of the symbols x l a 1 , x l a 2 , x l `, or x l 2`. NOTE 3 For the special case in which f sad - tsad - 0, f 9 and t9 are continuous, and t9 sad ± 0, it is easy to see why l’Hospital’s Rule is true. In fact, using the alternative form of the deinition of a derivative, we have lim x la f 9 s xd t9 s xd - f 9 sad t9 sad - lim x la f s xd 2 f sad x 2 a lim x la ts xd 2 tsad x 2 a - lim x la f s xd 2 f sad x 2 a ts xd 2 tsad x 2 a - lim x la f s xd 2 f sad ts xd 2 tsad - lim x la f s xd ts xd fsince f sad - t sad - 0g It is more dificult to prove the general version of l’Hospital’s Rule. See Appendix F. EXAMPLE 1 Find lim x l1 ln x x 2 1 . SOLUTION Since lim x l1 ln x - ln 1 - 0 and lim x l1 s x 2 1d - 0 the limit is an indeterminate form of type 0 0 , so we can apply l’Hospital’s Rule: lim x l1 ln x x 2 1 - lim x l1 d dx sln xd d dx s x 2 1d - lim x l1 1 yx 1 - lim x l1 1 x - 1 ■ EXAMPLE 2 Calculate lim x l ` e x x 2 . SOLUTION We have lim x l ` e x - ` and lim x l ` x 2 - `, so the limit is an indetermi- nate form of type `y`, and l’Hospital’s Rule gives lim x l ` e x x 2 - lim x l ` d dx se x d d dx s x 2 d - lim x l ` e x 2x Since e x l ` and 2x l ` as x l `, the limit on the right side is also indeterminate, but a second application of l’Hospital’s Rule gives lim x l` e x x 2 - lim x l` e x 2x - lim x l` e x 2 - ` ■ L’Hospital L’Hospital’s Rule is named after a French nobleman, the Marquis de l’Hospital (1661–1704), but was discovered by a Swiss mathematician, John Bernoulli (1667–1748). You might sometimes see l’Hospital spelled as l’Hôpital, but he spelled his own name l’Hospital, as was common in the 17th century. See Exercise 83 for the example that the Marquis used to illustrate his rule. See the project on page 314 for further historical details. Notice that when using l’Hospital’s Rule we differentiate the numerator and denominator sepa- rately. We do not use the Quotient Rule. The graph of the function of Example 2 is shown in Figure 2. We have noticed previously that exponential functions grow far more rapidly than power func- tions, so the result of Example 2 is not unexpected. See also Exercise 73. y= ´ ≈ 10 20 0 FIGURE 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

","307 SECTION 4.4 Indeterminate Forms and l’Hospital’s Rule 307 EXAMPLE 3 Calculate lim x l` ln x s x . SOLUTION Since ln x l ` and sx l ` as x l ` , l’Hospital’s Rule applies: lim x l` ln x s x - lim x l` 1yx 1 2 x 21y2 - lim x l` 1yx 1y ( 2 s x ) Notice that the limit on the right side is now indeterminate of type 0 0 . But instead of applying l’Hospital’s Rule a second time as we did in Example 2, we simplify the expression and see that a second application is unnecessary: lim x l` ln x s x - lim x l` 1yx 1y ( 2 s x ) - lim x l ` 2 s x - 0 ■ In both Examples 2 and 3 we evaluated limits of type `y`, but we got two different results. In Example 2, the ininite limit tells us that the numerator e x increases signii- cantly faster than the denominator x 2 , resulting in larger and larger ratios. In fact, y - e x grows more quickly than all the power functions y - x n (see Exercise 73). In Example 3 we have the opposite situation; the limit of 0 means that the denominator outpaces the numerator, and the ratio eventually approaches 0. EXAMPLE 4 Find lim x l0 tan x 2 x x 3 . (See Exercise 2.2.50.) SOLUTION Noting that both tan x 2 x l 0 and x 3 l 0 as x l 0, we use l’Hospital’s Rule: lim x l 0 tan x 2 x x 3 - lim x l 0 sec 2 x 2 1 3x 2 Since the limit on the right side is still indeterminate of type 0 0 , we apply l’Hospital’s Rule again: lim x l0 sec 2 x 2 1 3x 2 - lim x l0 2 sec 2 x tan x 6x Because lim x l0 sec 2 x - 1, we simplify the calculation by writing lim x l 0 2 sec 2 x tan x 6x - 1 3 lim x l 0 sec 2 x ? lim x l 0 tan x x - 1 3 lim x l 0 tan x x We can evaluate this last limit either by using l’Hospital’s Rule a third time or by writing tan x as ssin xdyscos xd and making use of our knowledge of trigonometric limits. Putting together all the steps, we get lim x l0 tan x 2 x x 3 - lim x l0 sec 2 x 2 1 3x 2 - lim x l0 2 sec 2 x tan x 6x - 1 3 lim x l0 tan x x - 1 3 lim x l0 sec 2 x 1 - 1 3 ■ 0 _1 2 10 ,000 y= ln x oe„ x FIGURE 3 The graph of the function of Example 3 is shown in Figure 3. We have dis- cussed previously the slow growth of logarithms, so it isn’t surprising that this ratio approaches 0 as x l `. See also Exercise 74. The graph in Figure 4 gives visual conirmation of the result of Example 4. If we were to zoom in too far, how- ever, we would get an inaccurate graph because tan x is close to x when x is small.

","308 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation EXAMPLE 5 Find lim x l 2 sin x 1 2 cos x . SOLUTION If we blindly attempted to use l’Hospital’s Rule, we would get lim x l  2 sin x 1 2 cos x - lim x l  2 cos x sin x - 2` This is wrong! Although the numerator sin x l 0 as x l  2 , notice that the denomi- nator s1 2 cos xd does not approach 0, so l’Hospital’s Rule can’t be applied here. The required limit is, in fact, easy to ind because the function is continuous at  and the denominator is nonzero there: lim x l 2 sin x 1 2 cos x - sin  1 2 cos  - 0 1 2 s21d - 0 ■ Example 5 shows what can go wrong if you use l’Hospital’s Rule without think- ing. Other limits can be found using l’Hospital’s Rule but are more easily found by other methods. (See Examples 2.3.3, 2.3.5, and 2.6.3, and the discussion at the beginning of this section.) So when evaluating any limit, you should consider other methods before using l’Hospital’s Rule. Indeterminate Products If lim x l a f s xd - 0 and lim x l a ts xd - ` (or 2`), then it isn’t clear what the value of lim x l a f f s xd ts xdg, if any, will be. There is a struggle between f and t. If f wins, the answer will be 0; if t wins, the answer will be ` (or 2`). Or there may be a compromise where the answer is a finite nonzero number. This kind of limit is called an indetermi- nate form of type 0 ? `. We can deal with it by writing the product f t as a quotient: f t - f 1 yt or f t - t 1 yf This converts the given limit into an indeterminate form of type 0 0 or ` y` so that we can use l’Hospital’s Rule. EXAMPLE 6 Evaluate lim x l0 1 x ln x. SOLUTION The given limit is indeterminate because, as x l 0 1 , the first factor s xd approaches 0 while the second factor sln xd approaches 2`. Writing x - 1 ys1 yxd, we have 1 yx l ` as x l 0 1 , so l’Hospital’s Rule gives lim x l0 1 x ln x - lim x l0 1 ln x 1 yx - lim x l0 1 1 yx 21 yx 2 - lim x l0 1 s2xd - 0 ■ NOTE In solving Example 6 another possible option would have been to write lim x l 0 1 x ln x - lim x l 0 1 x 1 yln x This gives an indeterminate form of the type 0 0 , but if we apply l’Hospital’s Rule we get a more complicated expression than the one we started with. In general, when we rewrite an indeterminate product, we try to choose the option that leads to the simpler limit. Figure 5 shows the graph of the function in Example 6. Notice that the function is undefined at x - 0; the graph approaches the origin but never quite reaches it. 0 y x 1 y=x ln x FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","309 SECTION 4.4 Indeterminate Forms and l’Hospital’s Rule 309 Indeterminate Diferences If lim x l a f s xd - ` and lim x l a ts xd - `, then the limit lim x l a f f s xd 2 ts xdg is called an indeterminate form of type ` 2 `. Again there is a contest between f and t. Will the answer be ` ( f wins) or will it be 2` ( t wins) or will they compromise on a inite number? To ind out, we try to convert the difference into a quotient (for instance, by using a common denominator, or rationalization, or factoring out a common factor) so that we have an indeterminate form of type 0 0 or ` y` . EXAMPLE 7 Compute lim x l1 1 S 1 ln x 2 1 x 2 1 D . SOLUTION First notice that 1ysln xd l ` and 1ys x 2 1d l ` as x l 1 1 , so the limit is indeterminate of type `2`. Here we can start with a common denominator: lim x l1 1 S 1 ln x 2 1 x 2 1 D - lim x l1 1 x 2 1 2 ln x sx 2 1d ln x Both numerator and denominator have a limit of 0, so l’Hospital’s Rule applies, giving lim x l1 1 x 2 1 2 ln x sx 2 1d ln x - lim x l1 1 1 2 1 x sx 2 1d ? 1 x 1 ln x - lim x l1 1 x 2 1 x 2 1 1 x ln x Again we have an indeterminate limit of type 0 0 , so we apply l’Hospital’s Rule a second time: lim x l1 1 x 2 1 x 2 1 1 x ln x - lim x l1 1 1 1 1 x ? 1 x 1 ln x - lim x l1 1 1 2 1 ln x - 1 2 ■ EXAMPLE 8 Calculate lim x l` se x 2 xd . SOLUTION This is an indeterminate difference because both e x and x approach infinity. We would expect the limit to be infinity because e x l ` much faster than x. But we can verify this by factoring out x : e x 2 x - x S e x x 2 1 D The term e x yx l ` as x l ` by l’Hospital’s Rule and so we now have a product in which both factors grow large: lim x l` se x 2 xd - lim x l` F x S e x x 2 1 DG - ` ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In either method we are led to the indeterminate product ts xd ln f s xd, which is of type 0 ?`. EXAMPLE 9 Calculate lim x l0 1 s1 1 sin 4xd cot x . SOLUTION First notice that as x l 0 1 , we have 1 1 sin 4x l 1 and cot x l `, so the given limit is indeterminate (type 1 ` ). Let y - s1 1 sin 4xd cot x Then ln y - lnfs1 1 sin 4xd cot x g - cot x lns1 1 sin 4xd - lns1 1 sin 4 xd tan x so l’Hospital’s Rule gives lim x l0 1 ln y - lim x l0 1 lns1 1 sin 4xd tan x - lim x l0 1 4 cos 4x 1 1 sin 4x sec 2 x - 4 So far we have computed the limit of ln y, but what we want is the limit of y. To ind this we use the fact that y - e ln y : lim x l 0 1 s1 1 sin 4xd cot x - lim x l 0 1 y - lim x l 0 1 e ln y - e 4 ■ EXAMPLE 10 Find lim x l 0 1 x x . SOLUTION Notice that this limit is indeterminate since 0 x - 0 for any x . 0 but x 0 - 1 for any x ± 0. (Recall that 0 0 is undeined.) We could proceed as in Example 9 or by writing the function as an exponential: x x - se ln x d x - e x ln x In Example 6 we used l’Hospital’s Rule to show that lim x l 0 1 x ln x - 0 Although forms of the type 0 0 , ` 0 , and 1 ` are indeterminate, the form 0 ` is not indeterminate. (See Exercise 86.) The graph of the function y - x x , x . 0, is shown in Figure 6. Notice that although 0 0 is not deined, the values of the function approach 1 as x l 0 1 .

Some populations initally grow exponentially but eventually level off. Equations of the form Pstd - M 1 1 Ae 2kt where M, A, and k are positive constants, are called logistic equations and are often used to model such populations. (We will investigate these in detail in Chapter 9.) Here M is called the carrying capacity and represents the maximum population size that can be supported, and A - M 2 P0 P0 , where P0 is the initial population. (a) Compute lim t l ` Pstd.

Light enters the eye through the pupil and strikes the retina, where photoreceptor cells sense light and color. W. Stanley Stiles and B. H. Crawford studied the phenomenon in which measured brightness decreases as light enters farther from the center of the pupil. (See the figure.) B A A light beam A that enters through the center of the pupil measures brighter than a beam B entering near the edge of the pupil. They detailed their findings of this phenomenon, known as the Stiles–Crawford effect of the irst kind, in an important paper published in 1933. In particular, they observed that the amount of luminance sensed was not proportional to the area of the pupil as they expected. The percentage P of the total luminance entering a pupil of radius r mm that is sensed at the retina can be described by P - 1 2 10 2r 2 r 2 ln 10 where  is an experimentally determined constant, typically about 0.05.

WRITING PROJECT L’Hospital’s Rule was first published in 1696 in the Marquis de l’Hospital’s calculus textbook Analyse des Ininiment Petits, but the rule was discovered in 1694 by the Swiss mathematician John (Johann) Bernoulli. The explanation is that these two mathematicians had entered into a curious business arrangement whereby the Marquis de l’Hospital bought the rights to Ber- noulli’s mathematical discoveries. The details, including a translation of l’Hospital’s letter to Bernoulli proposing the arrangement, can be found in the book by Eves [1]. Write a report on the historical and mathematical origins of l’Hospital’s Rule. Start by pro- viding brief biographical details of both men (the dictionary edited by Gillispie [2] is a good source) and outline the business deal between them. Then give l’Hospital’s statement of his rule, which is found in Struik’s sourcebook [4] and more briely in the book of Katz [3]. Notice that l’Hospital and Bernoulli formulated the rule geometrically and gave the answer in terms of differentials. Compare their statement with the version of l’Hospital’s Rule given in Section 4.4 and show that the two statements are essentially the same. 1.

","SECTION 4.5 Summary of Curve Sketching 315 So far we have been concerned with some particular aspects of curve sketching: domain, range, and symmetry in Chapter 1; limits, continuity, and asymptotes in Chapter 2; deriv- atives and tangents in Chapters 2 and 3; and extreme values, intervals of increase and decrease, concavity , points of inlection, and l’Hospital’s Rule in this chapter. It is now time to put all of this information together to sketch graphs that reveal the important features of functions. You might ask: Why don’t we just use a graphing calculator or computer to graph a curve? Why do we need to use calculus? It’s true that modern technology is capable of producing very accurate graphs. But even the best graphing devices have to be used intelligently. It is easy to arrive at a misleading graph, or to miss important details of a curve, when relying solely on tech- nology. (See “Graphing Calculators and Computers” at www.stewartcalculus.com, espe- cially Examples 1, 3, 4, and 5. See also Section 4.6.) The use of calculus enables us to discover the most interesting aspects of graphs and in many cases to calculate maximum and minimum points and inlection points exactly instead of approximately. For instance, Figure 1 shows the graph of f s xd - 8x 3 2 21x 2 1 18x 1 2. At irst glance it seems reasonable: It has the same shape as cubic curves like y - x 3 , and it appears to have no maximum or minimum point. But if you compute the derivative, you will see that there is a maximum when x - 0.75 and a minimum when x - 1. Indeed, if we zoom in to this portion of the graph, we see that behavior exhibited in Figure 2. Without calculus, we could easily have overlooked it. In the next section we will graph functions by using the interaction between calculus and graphing devices. In this section we draw graphs by irst considering the following information. We don’t assume that you have a graphing device, but if you do have one you should use it as a check on your work. Guidelines for Sketching a Curve The following checklist is intended as a guide to sketching a curve y - f s xd by hand. Not every item is relevant to every function. (For instance, a given curve might not have an asymptote or possess symmetry.) But the guidelines provide all the information you need to make a sketch that displays the most important aspects of the function. A. Domain It’s often useful to start by determining the domain D of f , that is, the set of values of x for which f s xd is deined. B. Intercepts The y-intercept is f s0d and this tells us where the curve intersects the y-axis. To ind the x-intercepts, we set y - 0 and solve for x. (You can omit this step if the equation is dificult to solve.) C. Symmetry (i ) If f s2xd - f s xd for all x in D, that is, the equation of the curve is unchanged when x is replaced by 2x, then f is an even function and the curve is symmetric about the y-axis. This means that our work is cut in half. If we know what the curve looks like for x > 0, then we need only relect about the y-axis to obtain the com- plete curve [see Figure 3(a)]. Here are some examples: y - x 2 , y - x 4 , y - | x | , and y - cos x. (ii) If f s2xd - 2f s xd for all x in D, then f is an odd function and the curve is symmetric about the origin. Again we can obtain the complete curve if we know what it looks like for x > 0. [Rotate 180° about the origin; see Figure 3(b).] Some simple examples of odd functions are y - x, y - x 3 , y - x 5 , and y - sin x.

","316 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation (iii) If f s x 1 pd - f s xd for all x in D, where p is a positive constant, then f is called a periodic function and the smallest such number p is called the period. For instance, y - sin x has period 2 and y - tan x has period . If we know what the graph looks like in an interval of length p, then we can use translation to sketch the entire graph (see Figure 4). a-p a a+p a+2p x y 0 period p D. Asymptotes (i) Horizontal Asymptotes. Recall from Section 2.6 that if either lim x l ` f s xd - L or lim x l2` f s xd - L, then the line y - L is a horizontal asymptote of the curve y - f s xd. If it turns out that lim x l ` f s xd - ` (or 2`), then we do not have an asymptote to the right, but this fact is still useful information for sketching the curve. (ii) Vertical Asymptotes. Recall from Section 2.2 that the line x - a is a vertical asymptote if at least one of the following statements is true: lim x la 1 f s xd - ` lim x la 2 f s xd - ` lim x la 1 f s xd - 2` lim x la 2 f s xd - 2` (For rational functions you can locate the vertical asymptotes by equating the denomi- nator to 0 after canceling any common factors. But for other functions this method does not apply.) Furthermore, in sketching the curve it is very useful to know exactly which of the statements in (1) is true. If f sad is not deined but a is an endpoint of the domain of f , then you should compute lim x l a 2 f s xd or lim x l a 1 f s xd, whether or not this limit is ininite. (iii) Slant Asymptotes. These are discussed at the end of this section. E. Intervals of Increase or Decrease Use the I/D Test. Compute f 9 s xd and ind the intervals on which f 9 s xd is positive ( f is increasing) and the intervals on which f 9 s xd is negative ( f is decreasing). F. Local Maximum and Minimum Values Find the critical numbers of f [the num- bers c where f 9 scd - 0 or f 9 scd does not exist]. Then use the First Derivative Test. If f 9 changes from positive to negative at a critical number c, then f scd is a local maximum. If f 9 changes from negative to positive at c, then f scd is a local minimum. Although it is usually preferable to use the First Derivative Test, you can use the Second Derivative Test if f 9 scd - 0 and f 0scd ± 0. Then f 0scd . 0 implies that f scd is a local minimum, whereas f 0scd , 0 implies that f scd is a local maximum. G. Concavity and Points of Inlection Compute f 0s xd and use the Concavity Test. The curve is concave upward where f 0s xd . 0 and concave downward where f 0s xd , 0. Inlection points occur where the direction of concavity changes. H. Sketch the Curve Using the information in items A–G, draw the graph. Sketch the asymptotes as dashed lines. Plot the intercepts, maximum and minimum points, and inlection points. Then make the curve pass through these points, rising and falling according to E, with concavity according to G, and approaching the asymptotes.

","SECTION 4.5 Summary of Curve Sketching 317 If additional accuracy is desired near any point, you can compute the value of the derivative there.

The domain is h x | x 2 2 1 ± 0j - h x | x ± 61j - s2`, 21d ø s21, 1d ø s1, `d B. The x- and y-intercepts are both 0. C. Since f s2xd - f s xd, the function f is even. The curve is symmetric about the y-axis. D. lim x l6` 2x 2 x 2 2 1 - lim x l6` 2 1 2 1 yx 2 - 2 Therefore the line y - 2 is a horizontal asymptote. Since the denominator is 0 when x - 61, we compute the following limits: lim x l1 1 2x 2 x 2 2 1 - ` lim x l1 2 2x 2 x 2 2 1 - 2` lim x l21 1 2x 2 x 2 2 1 - 2` lim x l21 2 2x 2 x 2 2 1 - ` Therefore the lines x - 1 and x - 21 are vertical asymptotes. This information about limits and asymptotes enables us to draw the preliminary sketch in Figure 5, showing the parts of the curve near the asymptotes. E. f 9 s xd - s x 2 2 1ds4xd 2 2x 2 ? 2x s x 2 2 1d 2 - 24x s x 2 2 1d 2 Since f 9 s xd . 0 when x , 0 s x ± 21d and f 9 s xd , 0 when x . 0 s x ± 1d, f is increasing on s2`, 21d and s21, 0d and decreasing on s0, 1d and s1, `d. F. The only critical number is x - 0. Since f 9 changes from positive to negative at 0, f s0d - 0 is a local maximum by the First Derivative Test. G. f 0s xd - s x 2 2 1d 2 s24d 1 4x ? 2s x 2 2 1d 2x s x 2 2 1d 4 - 12x 2 1 4 s x 2 2 1d 3 Since 12x 2 1 4 . 0 for all x, we have f 0s xd . 0 &? x 2 2 1 . 0 &? | x | . 1 and f 0s xd , 0 &? | x | , 1. Thus the curve is concave upward on the intervals s2`, 21d and s1, `d and concave downward on s21, 1d. It has no point of inlec- tion since 1 and 21 are not in the domain of f . H. Using the information in E – G, we inish the sketch in Figure 6. ■ EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph of f s xd - x 2 sx 1 1 . A.

The x- and y-intercepts are both 0. C. Symmetry: None D. Since lim x l` x 2 sx 1 1 - ` there is no horizontal asymptote. Since sx 1 1 l 0 as x l 21 1 and f s xd is always positive, we have lim x l21 1 x 2 sx 1 1 - ` and so the line x - 21 is a vertical asymptote.

Since f 9 s xd , 0 when 21 , x , 0 and f 9 s xd . 0 when x . 0, f is decreasing on s21, 0d and increasing on s0, `d. F. Since f 9 s0d - 0 and f 9 changes from negative to positive at 0, f s0d - 0 is a local (and absolute) minimum by the First Derivative Test.

The numerator is the quadratic 3x 2 1 8x 1 8, which is always positive because its discriminant is b 2 2 4ac - 232, which is negative, and the coeficient of x 2 is positive. Thus f 0s xd . 0 for all x in the domain of f , which means that f is concave upward on s21, `d and there is no point of inlection. H. The curve is sketched in Figure 7. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Sketch the graph of f s xd - xe x . A. The domain is R. B. The x- and y-intercepts are both 0. C. Symmetry: None D. Because both x and e x become large as x l `, we have lim x l ` xe x - `. As x l 2`, however, e x l 0 and so we have an indeterminate product that requires the use of l’Hospital’s Rule: lim x l2` xe x - lim x l2` x e 2x - lim x l2` 1 2e 2x - lim x l2` s2e x d - 0 Thus the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote. E. f 9 s xd - xe x 1 e x - s x 1 1de x Since e x is always positive, we see that f 9 s xd . 0 when x 1 1 . 0, and f 9 s xd , 0 when x 1 1 , 0. So f is increasing on s21, `d and decreasing on s2`, 21d. F. Because f 9 s21d - 0 and f 9 changes from negative to positive at x - 21, f s21d - 2e 21 < 20.37 is a local (and absolute) minimum.

The y-intercept is f s0d - ln 4. T o ind the x-intercept we set y - lns4 2 x 2 d - 0 We know that ln 1 - 0, so we have 4 2 x 2 - 1 ? x 2 - 3 and therefore the x-intercepts are 6s3 . C . Since f s2xd - f s xd, f is even and the curve is symmetric about the y-axis. D. We look for vertical asymptotes at the endpoints of the domain.

Using this information, we sketch the curve in Figure 11. ■ Slant Asymptotes Some curves have asymptotes that are oblique, that is, neither horizontal nor vertical. If lim x l ` f f s xd 2 smx 1 bdg - 0 where m ± 0, then the line y - mx 1 b is called a slant asymptote because the ver- tical distance between the curve y - f s xd and the line y - mx 1 b approaches 0, as in Figure 12. (A similar situation exists if we let x l 2`.) For rational functions, slant  asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator. In such a case the equation of the slant asymptote can be found by long division as in the following example. EXAMPLE 6 Sketch the graph of f s xd - x 3 x 2 1 1 . A. The domain is R - s2`, `d. B. The x- and y-intercepts are both 0. C. Since f s2xd - 2f s xd, f is odd and its graph is symmetric about the origin. D. Since x 2 1 1 is never 0, there is no vertical asymptote.

Then use your results to help sketch the graph of f . 76. Use the asymptotic behavior of f s xd - sin x 1 e 2x to sketch its graph without going through the curve- sketching procedure of this section. The method we used to sketch curves in the preceding section was a culmination of much of our study of differential calculus. The graph was the inal object that we produced. In this section our point of view is completely different. Here we start with a graph produced by a graphing calculator or computer and then we reine it. We use calculus to make sure that we reveal all the important aspects of the curve. And with the use of graphing devices we can tackle curves that would be far too complicated to consider without technology. The theme is the interaction between calculus and calculators. EXAMPLE 1 Graph the polynomial f s xd - 2x 6 1 3x 5 1 3x 3 2 2x 2 . Use the graphs of f 9 and f 0 to estimate all maximum and minimum points and intervals of concavity. SOLUTION If we specify a domain but not a range, many graphing devices will deduce a suitable range from the values computed. Figure 1 shows the plot from one such device if we specify that 25 < x < 5. Although this viewing rectangle is useful for showing that the asymptotic behavior (or end behavior) is the same as for y - 2x 6 , it is obviously hiding some iner detail. So we change to the viewing rectangle f23, 2g by f250, 100g shown in Figure 2.

","324 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation From this graph it appears that there is an absolute minimum value of about 215.33 when x < 21.62 (by using the cursor) and f is decreasing on s2`, 21.62d and increasing on s21.62, `d. Also there appears to be a horizontal tangent at the origin and inlection points when x - 0 and when x is somewhere between 22 and 21. Now let’s try to conirm these impressions using calculus. We differentiate and get f 9 s xd - 12x 5 1 15x 4 1 9x 2 2 4x f 0s xd - 60x 4 1 60x 3 1 18x 2 4 When we graph f 9 in Figure 3 we see that f 9 s xd changes from negative to positive when x < 21.62; this conirms (by the First Derivative Test) the minimum value that we found earlier. But, perhaps to our surprise, we also notice that f 9 s xd changes from posi- tive to negative when x - 0 and from negative to positive when x < 0.35. This means that f has a local maximum at 0 and a local minimum when x < 0.35, but these were hidden in Figure 2. Indeed, if we now zoom in toward the origin in Figure 4, we see what we missed before: a local maximum value of 0 when x - 0 and a local minimum value of about 20.1 when x < 0.35. What about concavity and inlection points? From Figures 2 and 4 there appear to be inlection points when x is a little to the left of 21 and when x is a little to the right of 0. But it’s dificult to determine inlection points from the graph of f , so we graph the second derivative f 0 in Figure 5. We see that f 0 changes from positive to negative when x < 21.23 and from negative to positive when x < 0.19. So, correct to two deci- mal places, f is concave upward on s2`, 21.23d and s0.19, `d and concave downward on s21.23, 0.19d. The inlection points are s21.23, 210.18d and s0.19, 20.05d. We have discovered that no single graph reveals all the important features of this polynomial. But Figures 2 and 4, when taken together, do provide an accurate picture. ■ EXAMPLE 2 Draw the graph of the function f s xd - x 2 1 7x 1 3 x 2 in a viewing rectangle that contains all the important features of the function. Estimate the maximum and minimum values and the intervals of concavity. Then use calculus to ind these quantities exactly. SOLUTION Figure 6, produced by a computer with automatic scaling, is a disaster. Some graphing calculators use f210, 10g by f210, 10g as the default viewing rect- angle, so let’s try it. We get the graph shown in Figure 7; it’s a major improvement. 3  10!* _5 5 y=ƒ 10 _10 _10 10 y=ƒ FIGURE 6 FIGURE 7 FIGURE 3 FIGURE 4 20 _5 _3 2 y=fª(x) 1 _1 _1 1 y=ƒ 10 _30 _3 2 y=f ·(x) FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 4.6 Graphing with Calculus and Calculators 325 The y-axis appears to be a vertical asymptote and indeed it is because lim x l 0 x 2 1 7x 1 3 x 2 - ` Figure 7 also allows us to estimate the x-intercepts: about 20.5 and 26.5. The exact values are obtained by using the quadratic formula to solve the equation x 2 1 7x 1 3 - 0; we get x - (27 6 s37 ) y 2. To get a better look at horizontal asymptotes, we change to the viewing rectangle f220, 20g by f25, 10g in Figure 8. It appears that y - 1 is the horizontal asymptote and this is easily conirmed: lim x l 6` x 2 1 7x 1 3 x 2 - lim x l 6` S 1 1 7 x 1 3 x 2 D - 1 To estimate the minimum value we zoom in to the viewing rectangle f23, 0g by f24, 2g in Figure 9. The cursor indicates that the absolute minimum value is about 23.1 when x < 20.9, and we see that the function decreases on s2`, 20.9d and s0, `d and increases on s20.9, 0d. The exact values are obtained by differentiating: f 9 s xd - 2 7 x 2 2 6 x 3 - 2 7x 1 6 x 3 This shows that f 9 s xd . 0 when 2 6 7 , x , 0 and f 9 s xd , 0 when x ,2 6 7 and when x . 0. The exact minimum value is f (2 6 7 ) - 2 37 12 < 23.08. Figure 9 also shows that an inlection point occurs somewhere between x - 21 and x - 22. We could estimate it much more accurately using the graph of the second derivative, but in this case it’ s just as easy to ind exact values. Since f 0s xd - 14 x 3 1 18 x 4 - 2s 7x 1 9d x 4 we see that f 0s xd . 0 when x .2 9 7 s x ± 0d. So f is concave upward on s2 9 7 , 0d and s0, `d and concave downward on s2`, 2 9 7 d. The inlection point is s2 9 7 , 2 71 27 d. The analysis using the irst two derivatives shows that Figure 8 displays all the major aspects of the curve. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Graph the function f s xd - x 2 s x 1 1d 3 s x 2 2d 2 s x 2 4d 4 . SOLUTION Drawing on our experience with a rational function in Example 2, let’s start by graphing f in the viewing rectangle f210, 10g by f210, 10g. From Figure 10 we have the feeling that we are going to have to zoom in to see some iner detail and also zoom out to see the larger picture. But, as a guide to intelligent zooming, let’s irst take a close look at the expression for f s xd. Because of the factors s x 2 2d 2 and s x 2 4d 4 in the denominator, we expect x - 2 and x - 4 to be the vertical asymp- totes. Indeed lim x l2 x 2 s x 1 1d 3 s x 2 2d 2 s x 2 4d 4 - ` and lim x l 4 x 2 s x 1 1d 3 s x 2 2d 2 s x 2 4d 4 - ` 10 _5 _20 20 y=ƒ y=1 FIGURE 8 2 _4 _3 0 y=ƒ FIGURE 9 10 _10 _10 10 y=ƒ FIGURE 10 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","326 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation T o ind the horizontal asymptotes, we divide numerator and denominator by x 6 : x 2 s x 1 1d 3 s x 2 2d 2 s x 2 4d 4 - x 2 x 3 ? s x 1 1d 3 x 3 s x 2 2d 2 x 2 ? s x 2 4d 4 x 4 - 1 x S 1 1 1 x D 3 S 1 2 2 x D 2 S 1 2 4 x D 4 This shows that f s xd l 0 as x l 6`, so the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote. It is also very useful to consider the behavior of the graph near the x-intercepts using an analysis like that in Example 2.6.12. Since x 2 is positive, f s xd does not change sign at 0 and so its graph doesn’t cross the x-axis at 0. But, because of the factor s x 1 1d 3 , the graph does cross the x-axis at 21 and has a horizontal tangent there. Putting all this information together, but without using derivatives, we see that the curve has to look something like the one in Figure 11. Now that we know what to look for, we zoom in (several times) to produce the graphs in Figures 12 and 13 and zoom out (several times) to get Figure 14. 0.05 _0.05 _100 1 y=ƒ 0.0001 _0.0001 _1.5 0.5 y=ƒ 500 _10 _1 10 y=ƒ FIGURE 13 FIGURE 14 We can read from these graphs that the absolute minimum is about 20.02 and occurs when x < 220. There is also a local maximum < 0.00002 when x < 20.3 and a local minimum < 211 when x < 2.5. These graphs also show three inlection points near 235, 25, and 21 and two between 21 and 0. T o estimate the inlection points closely we would need to graph f 0, but to compute f 0 by hand is an unreasonable chore. If you have a computer algebra system, then it’s easy to do (see Exercise 15). We have seen that, for this particular function, three graphs (Figures 12, 13, and 14) are necessary to convey all the useful information. The only way to display all these features of the function on a single graph is to draw it by hand. Despite the exaggera- tions and distortions, Figure 11 does manage to summarize the essential nature of the function. ■ EXAMPLE 4 Graph the function f s xd - sins x 1 sin 2xd. For 0 < x < , estimate all maximum and minimum values, intervals of increase and decrease, and inlection points. SOLUTION We irst note that f is periodic with period 2. Also, f is odd and | f s xd | < 1 for all x. So the choice of a viewing rectangle is not a problem for this func- tion: We start with f0, g by f21.1, 1.1g. (See Figure 15.) It appears that there are three local maximum values and two local minimum values in that window. To conirm x y 1 2 3 _1 4 FIGURE 11 FIGURE 12 1.1 _1.1 0 π FIGURE 15 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Using zoom-in and the First Derivative T est, we ind the following approximate values: Intervals of increase: s0, 0.6d, s1.0, 1.6d, s2.1, 2.5d Intervals of decrease: s0.6, 1.0d, s1.6, 2.1d, s2.5, d Local maximum values: f s0.6d< 1, f s1.6d< 1, f s2.5d< 1 Local minimum values: f s1.0d< 0.94, f s2.1d< 0.94 The second derivative is f 0s xd - 2s1 1 2 cos 2 xd 2 sins x 1 sin 2xd 2 4 sin 2x coss x 1 sin 2 xd Graphing both f and f 0 in Figure 17, we obtain the following approximate values: Concave upward on: s0.8, 1.3d, s1.8, 2.3d Concave downward on: s0, 0.8d, s1.3, 1.8d, s2.3, d Inflection points: s0, 0d, s0.8, 0.97d, s1.3, 0.97d, s1.8, 0.97d, s2.3, 0.97d Having checked that Figure 15 does indeed represent f accurately for 0 < x < , we can state that the extended graph in Figure 18 represents f accurately for 22 < x < 2. ■ Our inal example is concerned with families of functions. This means that the func- tions in the family are related to each other by a formula that contains one or more arbi- trary constants. Each value of the constant gives rise to a member of the family and the idea is to see how the graph of the function changes as the constant changes. EXAMPLE 5 How does the graph of f s xd - 1 ys x 2 1 2x 1 cd vary as c varies?

","328 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation Before drawing any more graphs, let’s see what members of this family have in common. Since lim x l 6` 1 x 2 1 2x 1 c - 0 for any value of c, they all have the x-axis as a horizontal asymptote. A vertical asymp- tote will occur when x 2 1 2x 1 c - 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we get x - 21 6 s1 2 c . When c . 1, there is no vertical asymptote (as in Figure 19). When c - 1, the graph has a single vertical asymptote x - 21 because lim x l21 1 x 2 1 2x 1 1 - lim x l21 1 s x 1 1d 2 - ` When c , 1, there are two vertical asymptotes: x - 21 6 s1 2 c (as in Figure 20) Now we compute the derivative: f 9 s xd - 2 2x 1 2 s x 2 1 2x 1 cd 2 This shows that f 9 s xd - 0 when x - 21 (if c ± 1), f 9 s xd . 0 when x ,21, and f 9 s xd , 0 when x .21. For c > 1, this means that f increases on s2`, 21d and decreases on s21, `d. For c . 1, there is an absolute maximum value f s21d - 1 ysc 2 1d. For c , 1, f s21d - 1 ysc 2 1d is a local maximum value and the intervals of increase and decrease are interrupted at the vertical asymptotes. Figure 21 is a “slide show” displaying ive members of the family, all graphed in the viewing rectangle f25, 4g by f22, 2g. As predicted, a transition takes place from two vertical asymptotes to one at c - 1, and then to none for c . 1. As c increases from 1, we see that the maximum point becomes lower; this is explained by the fact that 1 ysc 2 1d l 0 as c l `. As c decreases from 1, the vertical asymptotes become more widely separated because the distance between them is 2 s 1 2 c , which becomes large as c l 2`. Again, the maximum point approaches the x-axis because 1 ysc 2 1d l 0 as c l 2`. c=3 c=2 c=1 c=0 c=_1 There is clearly no inlection point when c < 1. For c . 1 we calculate that f 0s xd - 2s3x 2 1 6x 1 4 2 cd s x 2 1 2x 1 cd 3 and deduce that inlection points occur when x - 21 6 s3sc 2 1d y3. So the inlection points become more spread out as c increases and this seems plausible from the last two parts of Figure 21. ■ FIGURE 21 The family of functions f s xd - 1ys x 2 1 2x 1 cd TEC See an animation of Figure 21 in Visual 4.6.

Start by computing the limits as The methods we have learned in this chapter for inding extreme values have practi- cal applications in many areas of life. A businessperson wants to minimize costs and maximize proits. A traveler wants to minimize transportation time. Fermat’s Principle in optics states that light follows the path that takes the least time. In this section we solve such problems as maximizing areas, volumes, and proits and minimizing distances, times, and costs. In solving such practical problems the greatest challenge is often to convert the word problem into a mathematical optimization problem by setting up the function that is to be maximized or minimized. Let’s recall the problem-solving principles discussed on page 71 and adapt them to this situation: Steps In Solving Optimization Problems 1. Understand the Problem The irst step is to read the problem carefully until it is clearly understood. Ask yourself: What is the unknown? What are the given quanti- ties? What are the given conditions? 2. Draw a Diagram In most problems it is useful to draw a diagram and identify the given and required quantities on the diagram. 3. Introduce Notation Assign a symbol to the quantity that is to be maximized or minimized (let’s call it Q for now). Also select symbols sa, b, c,..., x, yd for other unknown quantities and label the diagram with these symbols. It may help to use initials as suggestive symbols—for example, A for area, h for height, t for time. PS Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Express Q in terms of some of the other symbols from Step 3. 5. If Q has been expressed as a function of more than one variable in Step 4, use the given information to ind relationships (in the form of equations) among these variables. Then use these equations to eliminate all but one of the variables in the expression for Q. Thus Q will be expressed as a function of one variable x, say, Q - f s xd. Write the domain of this function in the given context. 6. Use the methods of Sections 4.1 and 4.3 to ind the absolute maximum or minimum value of f. In particular, if the domain of f is a closed interval, then the Closed Interval Method in Section 4.1 can be used. EXAMPLE 1 A farmer has 2400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular ield that borders a straight river. He needs no fence along the river. What are the dimensions of the ield that has the largest area? SOLUTION In order to get a feeling for what is happening in this problem, let’s experi- ment with some speciic cases. Figure 1 (not to scale) shows three possible ways of laying out the 2400 ft of fencing. 100 2200 100 Area=100 · 2200=220,000 ft@ 700 1000 700 Area=700 · 1000=700,000 ft@ 1000 400 1000 Area=1000 · 400=400,000 ft@ We see that when we try shallow, wide ields or deep, narrow ields, we get rela- tively small areas. It seems plausible that there is some intermediate coniguration that produces the largest area. Figure 2 illustrates the general case. We wish to maximize the area A of the rect- angle. Let x and y be the depth and width of the rectangle (in feet). Then we express A in terms of x and y: A - xy We want to express A as a function of just one variable, so we eliminate y by express- ing it in terms of x. To do this we use the given information that the total length of the fencing is 2400 ft. Thus 2x 1 y - 2400 From this equation we have y - 2400 2 2x, which gives A - xy - x s2400 2 2xd - 2400x 2 2x 2 Note that the largest x can be is 1200 (this uses all the fence for the depth and none for the width) and x can’t be negative, so the function that we wish to maximize is As xd - 2400x 2 2x 2 0 < x < 1200 PS Understand the problem PS Analogy: Try special cases PS Draw diagrams FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 x y A x PS Introduce notation Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","332 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation The derivative is A 9 s xd - 2400 2 4x, so to ind the critical numbers we solve the equation 2400 2 4x - 0 which gives x - 600. The maximum value of A must occur either at this critical number or at an endpoint of the interval. Since As0d - 0, As600d - 720,000, and As1200d - 0, the Closed Interval Method gives the maximum value as As600d - 720,000. [Alternatively, we could have observed that A0s xd - 24 , 0 for all x, so A is always concave downward and the local maximum at x - 600 must be an absolute maximum.] The corresponding y-value is y - 2400 2 2s600d - 1200; so the rectangular ield should be 600 ft deep and 1200 ft wide. ■ EXAMPLE 2 A cylindrical can is to be made to hold 1 L of oil. Find the dimensions that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can. SOLUTION Draw the diagram as in Figure 3, where r is the radius and h the height (both in centimeters). In order to minimize the cost of the metal, we minimize the total surface area of the cylinder (top, bottom, and sides). From Figure 4 we see that the sides are made from a rectangular sheet with dimensions 2r and h. So the surface area is A - 2r 2 1 2rh We would like to express A in terms of one variable, r. To eliminate h we use the fact that the volume is given as 1 L, which is equivalent to 1000 cm 3 . Thus r 2 h - 1000 which gives h - 1000 ysr 2 d. Substitution of this into the expression for A gives A - 2r 2 1 2r S 1000 r 2 D - 2r 2 1 2000 r We know r must be positive, and there are no limitations on how large r can be. There- fore the function that we want to minimize is Asrd - 2r 2 1 2000 r r . 0 To ind the critical numbers, we differentiate: A 9 srd - 4r 2 2000 r 2 - 4sr 3 2 500d r 2 Then A 9 s r d - 0 when r 3 - 500, so the only critical number is r - s 3 500y . Since the domain of A is s0, `d, we can’t use the argument of Example 1 concern- ing endpoints. But we can observe that A 9 s r d , 0 for r , s 3 500y and A 9 s r d . 0 for r . s 3 500y , so A is decreasing for all r to the left of the critical number and increas- ing for all r to the right. Thus r - s 3 500y must give rise to an absolute minimum. [Alternatively, we could argue that Asrd l ` as r l 0 1 and Asrd l ` as r l `, so there must be a minimum value of Asrd, which must occur at the critical number.

TEC Module 4.7 takes you through six additional optimization problems, including animations of the physical situations. NOTE 2 An alternative method for solving optimization problems is to use implicit differentiation. Let’s look at Example 2 again to illustrate the method. We work with the same equations A - 2r 2 1 2rh r 2 h - 1000 but instead of eliminating h, we differentiate both equations implicitly with respect to r : A 9 - 4r 1 2rh91 2h r 2 h91 2rh - 0 The minimum occurs at a critical number, so we set A 9 - 0, simplify, and arrive at the equations 2r 1 rh91 h - 0 rh91 2h - 0 and subtraction gives 2r 2 h - 0, or h - 2r. EXAMPLE 3 Find the point on the parabola y 2 - 2x that is closest to the point s1, 4d. SOLUTION The distance between the point s1, 4d and the point s x, yd is d - ss x 2 1d 2 1 s y 2 4d 2 (See Figure 6.) But if s x, yd lies on the parabola, then x - 1 2 y 2 , so the expression for d becomes d - s( 1 2 y 2 2 1) 2 1 s y 2 4d 2 (Alternatively, we could have substituted y - s2x to get d in terms of x alone.) Instead of minimizing d, we minimize its square: d 2 - f s yd - s 1 2 y 2 2 1d 2 1 s y 2 4d 2 In the Applied Project on page 343 we investigate the most economical shape for a can by taking into account other manufacturing costs. x y 0 1 1 2 3 4 ¥=2x (1, 4) (x, y) FIGURE 6 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","334 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation (You should convince yourself that the minimum of d occurs at the same point as the minimum of d 2 , but d 2 is easier to work with.) Note that there are no restrictions on y, so the domain is all real numbers. Differentiating, we obtain f 9 s yd - 2s 1 2 y 2 2 1d y 1 2s y 2 4d - y 3 2 8 so f 9 s yd - 0 when y - 2. Observe that f 9 s yd , 0 when y , 2 and f 9 s yd . 0 when y . 2, so by the First Derivative Test for Absolute Extreme Values, the absolute mini- mum occurs when y - 2. (Or we could simply say that because of the geometric nature of the problem, it’s obvious that there is a closest point but not a farthest point.) The corresponding value of x is x - 1 2 y 2 - 2. Thus the point on y 2 - 2x closest to s1, 4d is s2, 2d. [The distance between the points is d - sf s2d - s5 .] ■ EXAMPLE 4 A man launches his boat from point A on a bank of a straight river, 3 km wide, and wants to reach point B, 8 km downstream on the opposite bank, as quickly as possible (see Figure 7). He could row his boat directly across the river to point C and then run to B, or he could row directly to B, or he could row to some point D between C and B and then run to B. If he can row 6 kmyh and run 8 kmyh, where should he land to reach B as soon as possible? (We assume that the speed of the water is negli- gible compared with the speed at which the man rows.) SOLUTION If we let x be the distance from C to D, then the running distance is | DB | - 8 2 x and the Pythagorean Theorem gives the rowing distance as | AD | - sx 2 1 9 . We use the equation time - distance rate Then the rowing time is sx 2 1 9 y6 and the running time is s8 2 xdy8, so the total time T as a function of x is Ts xd - sx 2 1 9 6 1 8 2 x 8 The domain of this function T is f0, 8g. Notice that if x - 0, he rows to C and if x - 8, he rows directly to B.

SOLUTION 1 Let’s take the semicircle to be the upper half of the circle x 2 1 y 2 - r 2 with center the origin. Then the word inscribed means that the rectangle has two vertices on the semicircle and two vertices on the x-axis as shown in Figure 9. Let s x, yd be the vertex that lies in the irst quadrant. Then the rectangle has sides of lengths 2x and y, so its area is A - 2xy To eliminate y we use the fact that s x, yd lies on the circle x 2 1 y 2 - r 2 and so y - sr 2 2 x 2 . Thus A - 2x sr 2 2 x 2 The domain of this function is 0 < x < r. Its derivative is A 9 - 2 sr 2 2 x 2 2 2x 2 sr 2 2 x 2 - 2sr 2 2 2x 2 d sr 2 2 x 2 which is 0 when 2x 2 - r 2 , that is, x - ry s2 (since x > 0). This value of x gives a maximum value of A since As0d - 0 and Asrd - 0. Therefore the area of the largest inscribed rectangle is A S r s2 D - 2 r s2 Î r 2 2 r 2 2 - r 2 SOLUTION 2 A simpler solution is possible if we think of using an angle as a variable. Let  be the angle shown in Figure 10. Then the area of the rectangle is Asd - s2r cos dsr sin d - r 2 s2 sin  cos d - r 2 sin 2 We know that sin 2 has a maximum value of 1 and it occurs when 2 - y2. So Asd has a maximum value of r 2 and it occurs when  - y4. Notice that this trigonometric solution doesn’t involve differentiation. In fact, we didn’t need to use calculus at all. ■ Applications to Business and Economics In Section 3.7 we introduced the idea of marginal cost. Recall that if Cs xd, the cost func- tion, is the cost of producing x units of a certain product, then the marginal cost is the rate of change of C with respect to x. In other words, the marginal cost function is the derivative, C9 s xd, of the cost function. x T 0 1 2 4 6 y=T(x) FIGURE 8 x y 0 2x (x, y) y _r r FIGURE 9 r ¨ r cos ¨ r sin ¨ FIGURE 10 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","336 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation Now let’s consider marketing. Let ps xd be the price per unit that the company can charge if it sells x units. Then p is called the demand function (or price function) and we would expect it to be a decreasing function of x. (More units sold corresponds to a lower price.) If x units are sold and the price per unit is ps xd, then the total revenue is Rs xd - quantity 3 price - xps xd and R is called the revenue function. The derivative R9 of the revenue function is called the marginal revenue function and is the rate of change of revenue with respect to the number of units sold. If x units are sold, then the total proit is Ps xd - Rs xd 2 Cs xd and P is called the proit function. The marginal proit function is P9, the derivative of the proit function. In Exercises 59–63 you are asked to use the marginal cost, revenue, and proit functions to minimize costs and maximize revenues and proits. EXAMPLE 6 A store has been selling 200 lat-screen TVs a week at $350 each. A mar- ket survey indicates that for each $10 rebate offered to buyers, the number of TVs sold will increase by 20 a week. Find the demand function and the revenue function. How large a rebate should the store offer to maximize its revenue? SOLUTION If x is the number of TVs sold per week, then the weekly increase in sales is x 2 200. For each increase of 20 units sold, the price is decreased by $10. So for each additional unit sold, the decrease in price will be 1 20 3 10 and the demand function is ps xd - 350 2 10 20 s x 2 200d - 450 2 1 2 x The revenue function is Rs xd - xps xd - 450x 2 1 2 x 2 Since R9 s xd - 450 2 x, we see that R9 s xd - 0 when x - 450. This value of x gives an absolute maximum by the First Derivative Test (or simply by observing that the graph of R is a parabola that opens downward). The corresponding price is ps450d - 450 2 1 2 s450d - 225 and the rebate is 350 2 225 - 125. Therefore, to maximize revenue, the store should offer a rebate of $125. ■ First number Second number Product 1 22 22 2 21 42 3 20 60 . . . . . . . . . 1.

The blood vascular system consists of blood vessels (arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins) that convey blood from the heart to the organs and back to the heart. This system should work so as to minimize the energy expended by the heart in pumping the blood. In particular, this energy is reduced when the resistance of the blood is lowered.

Ornithologists have determined that some species of birds tend to avoid lights over large bodies of water during daylight hours. It is believed that more energy is required to ly over water than over land because air generally rises over land and falls over water during the day.

","APPLIED PROJECT The Shape of a Can 343 In this project we investigate the most economical shape for a can. We irst interpret this to mean that the volume V of a cylindrical can is given and we need to ind the height h and radius r that minimize the cost of the metal to make the can (see the igure). If we disregard any waste metal in the manufacturing process, then the problem is to minimize the surface area of the cylinder. We solved this problem in Example 4.7.2 and we found that h - 2r ; that is, the height should be the same as the diameter. But if you go to your cupboard or your supermarket with a ruler, you will discover that the height is usually greater than the diameter and the ratio hy r varies from 2 up to about 3.8. Let’s see if we can explain this phenomenon. 1. The material for the cans is cut from sheets of metal. The cylindrical sides are formed by bending rectangles; these rectangles are cut from the sheet with little or no waste. But if the top and bottom discs are cut from squares of side 2r (as in the igure), this leaves considerable waste metal, which may be recycled but has little or no value to the can makers. If this is the case, show that the amount of metal used is minimized when h r - 8  < 2.55 2. A more eficient packing of the discs is obtained by dividing the metal sheet into hexagons and cutting the circular lids and bases from the hexagons (see the igure). Show that if this strategy is adopted, then h r - 4 s3  < 2.21 3. The values of hy r that we found in Problems 1 and 2 are a little closer to the ones that actually occur on supermarket shelves, but they still don’t account for everything. If we look more closely at some real cans, we see that the lid and the base are formed from discs with radius larger than r that are bent over the ends of the can. If we allow for this we would increase hy r. More significantly, in addition to the cost of the metal we need to incorporate the manufacturing of the can into the cost. Let’s assume that most of the expense is incurred in joining the sides to the rims of the cans. If we cut the discs from hexagons as in Problem 2, then the total cost is proportional to 4 s3 r 2 1 2rh 1 ks4r 1 hd where k is the reciprocal of the length that can be joined for the cost of one unit area of metal. Show that this expression is minimized when s 3 V k - Î h r ? 2 2 hyr hyr 2 4 s3 4. Plot s 3 V yk as a function of x - hy r and use your graph to argue that when a can is large or joining is cheap, we should make hy r approximately 2.21 (as in Problem 2). But when the can is small or joining is costly, hy r should be substantially larger. 5. Our analysis shows that large cans should be almost square but small cans should be tall and thin. Take a look at the relative shapes of the cans in a supermarket. Is our conclusion usu- ally true in practice? Are there exceptions? Can you suggest reasons why small cans are not always tall and thin? 3 ; r h Discs cut from squares Discs cut from hexagons APPLIED PROJECT THE SHAPE OF A CAN Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","344 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation APPLIED PROJECT PLANES AND BIRDS: MINIMIZING ENERGY Small birds like inches alternate between lapping their wings and keeping them folded while gliding (see Figure 1). In this project we analyze this phenomenon and try to determine how frequently a bird should lap its wings. Some of the principles are the same as for ixed-wing aircraft and so we begin by considering how required power and energy depend on the speed of airplanes. 1 FIGURE 1 1. The power needed to propel an airplane forward at velocity v is P - Av 3 1 BL 2 v where A and B are positive constants speciic to the particular aircraft and L is the lift, the upward force supporting the weight of the plane. Find the speed that minimizes the required power. 2. The speed found in Problem 1 minimizes power but a faster speed might use less fuel. The energy needed to propel the airplane a unit distance is E - Pyv. At what speed is energy minimized? 3. Hows much faster is the speed for minimum energy than the speed for minimum power? 4. In applying the equation of Problem 1 to bird light we split the term Av 3 into two parts: Abv 3 for the bird’s body and Awv 3 for its wings.

","SECTION 4.8 Newton’s Method 345 Suppose that a car dealer offers to sell you a car for $18,000 or for payments of $375 per month for ive years. You would like to know what monthly interest rate the dealer is, in effect, charging you. To ind the answer, you have to solve the equation 48x s1 1 xd 60 2 s1 1 xd 60 1 1 - 0 (The details are explained in Exercise 41.) How would you solve such an equation? For a quadratic equation ax 2 1 bx 1 c - 0 there is a well-known formula for the solutions. For third- and fourth-degree equations there are also formulas for the solu- tions, but they are extremely complicated. If f is a polynomial of degree 5 or higher, there is no such formula (see the note on page 211). Likewise, there is no formula that will enable us to ind the exact roots of a transcendental equation such as cos x - x. We can ind an approximate solution to Equation 1 by plotting the left side of the equation. Using a graphing device, and after experimenting with viewing rectangles, we produce the graph in Figure 1. We see that in addition to the solution x - 0, which doesn’t interest us, there is a solution between 0.007 and 0.008. Zooming in shows that the root is approximately 0.0076. If we need more accuracy we could zoom in repeatedly, but that becomes tire- some. A faster alternative is to use a calculator or computer algebra system to solve the equation numerically. If we do so, we ind that the root, correct to nine decimal places, is 0.007628603. How do these devices solve equations? They use a variety of methods, but most of them make some use of Newton’s method, also called the Newton-Raphson method. We will explain how this method works, partly to show what happens inside a calculator or computer, and partly as an application of the idea of linear approximation. The geometry behind Newton’s method is shown in Figure 2. We wish to solve an equation of the form f s xd - 0, so the roots of the equation correspond to the x-intercepts of the graph of f. The root that we are trying to ind is labeled r in the igure. We start with a irst approximation x 1 , which is obtained by guessing, or from a rough sketch of the graph of f , or from a computer-generated graph of f. Consider the tangent line L to the curve y - f s xd at the point s x 1 , f s x 1 dd and look at the x-intercept of L, labeled x 2 . The idea behind Newton’s method is that the tangent line is close to the curve and so its x-intercept, x 2 , is close to the x-intercept of the curve (namely, the root r that we are seeking). Because the tangent is a line, we can easily find its x-intercept. To find a formula for x 2 in terms of x 1 we use the fact that the slope of L is f 9 sx 1 d, so its equation is y 2 f s x 1 d - f 9 s x 1 ds x 2 x 1 d Since the x-intercept of L is x 2 , we know that the point s x 2 , 0d is on the line, and so 0 2 f s x 1 d - f 9 s x 1 ds x 2 2 x 1 d If f 9 s x 1 d ± 0, we can solve this equation for x 2 : x 2 - x 1 2 f s x 1 d f 9 s x 1 d We use x 2 as a second approximation to r . 1 0.15 _0.05 0 0.012 FIGURE 1 Try to solve Equation 1 numerically using your calculator or computer.

","346 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation Next we repeat this procedure with x 1 replaced by the second approximation x 2 , using the tangent line at s x 2 , f s x 2 dd. This gives a third approximation: x 3 - x 2 2 f s x 2 d f 9 s x 2 d If we keep repeating this process, we obtain a sequence of approximations x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 , . . . as shown in Figure 3. In general, if the nth approximation is x n and f 9 s x n d ± 0, then the next approximation is given by x n11 - x n 2 f s x n d f 9 s x n d If the numbers x n become closer and closer to r as n becomes large, then we say that the sequence converges to r and we write lim n l ` x n - r Although the sequence of successive approximations converges to the desired root for functions of the type illustrated in Figure 3, in certain circumstances the sequence may not converge. For example, consider the situation shown in Figure 4. You can see that x 2 is a worse approximation than x 1 . This is likely to be the case when f 9 s x 1 d is close to 0. It might even happen that an approximation (such as x 3 in Figure 4) falls outside the domain of f. Then Newton’s method fails and a better initial approximation x 1 should be chosen. See Exercises 31–34 for specific examples in which Newton’s method works very slowly or does not work at all. EXAMPLE 1 Starting with x 1 - 2, find the third approximation x 3 to the root of the equation x 3 2 2x 2 5 - 0.

","SECTION 4.8 Newton’s Method 347 It turns out that this third approximation x 3 < 2.0946 is accurate to four decimal places. ■ Suppose that we want to achieve a given accuracy, say to eight decimal places, using Newton’s method. How do we know when to stop? The rule of thumb that is generally used is that we can stop when successive approximations x n and x n11 agree to eight deci- mal places. (A precise statement concerning accuracy in Newton’s method will be given in Exercise 11.11.39.) Notice that the procedure in going from n to n 1 1 is the same for all values of n. (It is called an iterative process.) This means that Newton’s method is particularly convenient for use with a programmable calculator or a computer. EXAMPLE 2 Use Newton’s method to ind s 6 2 correct to eight decimal places. SOLUTION First we observe that inding s 6 2 is equivalent to inding the positive root of the equation x 6 2 2 - 0 so we take f s xd - x 6 2 2. Then f 9 s xd - 6x 5 and Formula 2 (Newton’s method) becomes x n11 - x n 2 f s x n d f 9 s x n d - x n 2 x n 6 2 2 6x n 5 If we choose x 1 - 1 as the initial approximation, then we obtain x 2 < 1.16666667 x 3 < 1.12644368 x 4 < 1.12249707 x 5 < 1.12246205 x 6 < 1.12246205 Since x 5 and x 6 agree to eight decimal places, we conclude that s 6 2 < 1.12246205 to eight decimal places. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Find, correct to six decimal places, the root of the equation cos x - x . SOLUTION We irst rewrite the equation in standard form: cos x 2 x - 0 Therefore we let f s xd - cos x 2 x. Then f 9 s xd - 2sin x 2 1, so Formula 2 becomes x n11 - x n 2 cos x n 2 x n 2sin x n 2 1 - x n 1 cos x n 2 x n sin x n 1 1 In order to guess a suitable value for x 1 we sketch the graphs of y - cos x and y - x in Figure 6.

Then Newton’s method gives x 2 < 0.73911114 x 3 < 0.73908513 x 4 < 0.73908513 and so we obtain the same answer as before, but with one fewer step. 1 0 1 y=x y=cos x FIGURE 7 1.

It isn’t dificult to discover an antiderivative of f if we keep the Power Rule in mind. In fact, if Fs xd - 1 3 x 3 , then F9 s xd - x 2 - f s xd. But the function Gs xd - 1 3 x 3 1 100 also satisies G9 s xd - x 2 . Therefore both F and G are antide- rivatives of f. Indeed, any function of the form Hs xd - 1 3 x 3 1 C, where C is a constant, is an antiderivative of f. The question arises: Are there any others? To answer this question, recall that in Section 4.2 we used the Mean Value Theorem to prove that if two functions have identical derivatives on an interval, then they must differ by a constant (Corollary 4.2.7). Thus if F and G are any two antiderivatives of f , then F9 s xd - f s xd - G9 s xd so Gs xd 2 Fs xd - C, where C is a constant. We can write this as Gs xd - Fs xd 1 C, so we have the following result. 1 Theorem If F is an antiderivative of f on an interval I , then the most general antiderivative of f on I is Fs xd 1 C where C is an arbitrary constant. Going back to the function f s xd - x 2 , we see that the general antiderivative of f is 1 3 x 3 1 C. By assigning speciic values to the constant C, we obtain a family of functions whose graphs are vertical translates of one another (see Figure 1). This makes sense because each curve must have the same slope at any given value of x. EXAMPLE 1 Find the most general antiderivative of each of the following functions. (a) f s xd - sin x (b) f s xd - 1 yx (c) f s xd - x n , n ± 21 SOLUTION (a) If Fs xd - 2cos x , then F9 s xd - sin x, so an antiderivative of sin x is 2cos x. By Theorem 1, the most general antiderivative is Gs xd - 2cos x 1 C. (b) Recall from Section 3.6 that d dx sln xd - 1 x So on the interval s0, `d the general antiderivative of 1 yx is ln x 1 C. We also learned that d dx (ln | x | ) - 1 x for all x ± 0. Theorem 1 then tells us that the general antiderivative of f s xd - 1 yx is ln | x | 1 C on any interval that doesn’t contain 0. In particular, this is true on each of the intervals s2`, 0d and s0, `d. So the general antiderivative of f is Fs xd - H ln x 1 C 1 lns2xd 1 C 2 if x . 0 if x , 0 (c) We use the Power Rule to discover an antiderivative of x n . In fact, if n ± 21, then d dx S x n11 n 1 1 D - sn 1 1d x n n 1 1 - x n FIGURE 1 Members of the family of antiderivatives of f s xd - x 2 x y 0 y= ˛ 3 y= -2 ˛ 3 y= -1 ˛ 3 y= +1 ˛ 3 y= +2 ˛ 3 y= +3 ˛ 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In Table 2 we list some particular antiderivatives. Each formula in the table is true because the derivative of the function in the right column appears in the left column. In particular, the first formula says that the antiderivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the antiderivative of the function. The second formula says that the antiderivative of a sum is the sum of the antiderivatives. (We use the notation F9 - f , G9 - t.)

","SECTION 4.9 Antiderivatives 353 In applications of calculus it is very common to have a situation as in Example 2, where it is required to ind a function, given knowledge about its derivatives. An equation that involves the derivatives of a function is called a differential equation. These will be studied in some detail in Chapter 9, but for the present we can solve some elementary differential equations. The general solution of a differential equation involves an arbi- trary constant (or constants) as in Example 2. However, there may be some extra condi- tions given that will determine the constants and therefore uniquely specify the solution. EXAMPLE 3 Find f if f 9 s xd - e x 1 20s1 1 x 2 d 21 and f s0d - 22. SOLUTION The general antiderivative of f 9 s xd - e x 1 20 1 1 x 2 is f s xd - e x 1 20 tan 21 x 1 C To determine C we use the fact that f s0d - 22: f s0d - e 0 1 20 tan 21 0 1 C - 22 Thus we have C - 22 2 1 - 23, so the particular solution is f s xd - e x 1 20 tan 21 x 2 3 ■ EXAMPLE 4 Find f if f 0s xd - 12x 2 1 6x 2 4, f s0d - 4, and f s1d - 1. SOLUTION The general antiderivative of f 0s xd - 12x 2 1 6x 2 4 is f 9 s xd - 12 x 3 3 1 6 x 2 2 2 4x 1 C - 4x 3 1 3x 2 2 4x 1 C Using the antidifferentiation rules once more, we find that f s xd - 4 x 4 4 1 3 x 3 3 2 4 x 2 2 1 Cx 1 D - x 4 1 x 3 2 2x 2 1 Cx 1 D To determine C and D we use the given conditions that f s0d - 4 and f s1d - 1. Since f s0d - 0 1 D - 4, we have D - 4. Since f s1d - 1 1 1 2 2 1 C 1 4 - 1 we have C - 23. Therefore the required function is f s xd - x 4 1 x 3 2 2x 2 2 3x 1 4 ■ If we are given the graph of a function f, it seems reasonable that we should be able to sketch the graph of an antiderivative F . Suppose, for instance, that we are given that Fs0d - 1. Then we have a place to start, the point s0,1d, and the direction in which we move our pencil is given at each stage by the derivative F9 s xd - f s xd. In the next example we use the principles of this chapter to show how to graph F even when we don’t have a formula for f. This would be the case, for instance, when f s xd is determined by experimental data. Figure 2 shows the graphs of the func- tion f 9 in Example 3 and its anti- derivative f . Notice that f 9 s xd . 0, so f is always increasing. Also notice that when f 9 has a maximum or minimum, f appears to have an inlection point. So the graph serves as a check on our calculation.

","354 CHAPTER 4 Applications of Diferentiation EXAMPLE 5 The graph of a function f is given in Figure 3. Make a rough sketch of an antiderivative F , given that Fs0d - 2. SOLUTION We are guided by the fact that the slope of y - Fs xd is f s xd. We start at the point s0, 2d and draw F as an initially decreasing function since f s xd is negative when 0 , x , 1. Notice that f s1d - f s3d - 0, so F has horizontal tangents when x - 1 and x - 3. For 1 , x , 3, f s xd is positive and so F is increasing. We see that F has a local minimum when x - 1 and a local maximum when x - 3. For x . 3, f s xd is negative and so F is decreasing on s3, `d. Since f s xd l 0 as x l `, the graph of F becomes latter as x l `. Also notice that F 0s xd - f 9 s xd changes from positive to negative at x - 2 and from negative to positive at x - 4, so F has inlection points when x - 2 and x - 4. We use this information to sketch the graph of the antiderivative in Figure 4. ■ Rectilinear Motion Antidifferentiation is particularly useful in analyzing the motion of an object moving in a straight line. Recall that if the object has position function s - f std, then the velocity function is vstd - s9 std. This means that the position function is an antiderivative of the velocity function. Likewise, the acceleration function is astd - v9 std, so the velocity function is an antiderivative of the acceleration. If the acceleration and the initial values ss0d and vs0d are known, then the position function can be found by antidifferentiating twice. EXAMPLE 6 A particle moves in a straight line and has acceleration given by astd - 6t 1 4. Its initial velocity is vs0d - 26 cmy s and its initial displacement is ss0d - 9 cm. Find its position function sstd. SOLUTION Since v9 std - astd - 6t 1 4, antidifferentiation gives vstd - 6 t 2 2 1 4t 1 C - 3t 2 1 4t 1 C Note that vs0d - C. But we are given that vs0d - 26, so C - 26 and vstd - 3t 2 1 4t 2 6 Since vstd - s9 std, s is the antiderivative of v: sstd - 3 t 3 3 1 4 t 2 2 2 6t 1 D - t 3 1 2t 2 2 6t 1 D This gives ss0d - D. We are given that ss0d - 9, so D - 9 and the required position function is sstd - t 3 1 2t 2 2 6t 1 9 ■ An object near the surface of the earth is subject to a gravitational force that produces a downward acceleration denoted by t. For motion close to the ground we may assume that t is constant, its value being about 9.8 mys 2 (or 32 ftys 2 ). EXAMPLE 7 A ball is thrown upward with a speed of 48 ftys from the edge of a cliff 432 ft above the ground. Find its height above the ground t seconds later. When does it reach its maximum height?

At time t the distance above the ground is sstd and the velocity vstd is decreasing. There- fore the acceleration must be negative and we have astd - dv dt - 232 Taking antiderivatives, we have vstd - 232t 1 C To determine C we use the given information that vs0d - 48. This gives 48 - 0 1 C, so vstd - 232t 1 48 The maximum height is reached when vstd - 0, that is, after 1.5 seconds. Since s9 std - vstd, we antidifferentiate again and obtain sstd - 216t 2 1 48t 1 D Using the fact that ss0d - 432, we have 432 - 0 1 D and so sstd - 216t 2 1 48t 1 432 The expression for sstd is valid until the ball hits the ground. This happens when sstd - 0, that is, when 216t 2 1 48t 1 432 - 0 or, equivalently, t 2 2 3t 2 27 - 0 Using the quadratic formula to solve this equation, we get t - 3 6 3s13 2 We reject the solution with the minus sign since it gives a negative value for t. Therefore the ball hits the ground after 3(1 1 s 13 ) y2 < 6.9 seconds. ■ Figure 5 shows the position function of the ball in Example 7. The graph cor- roborates the conclusions we reached: The ball reaches its maximum height after 1.5 seconds and hits the ground after about 6.9 seconds. 500 0 8 FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Integrals IN CHAPTER 2 we used the tangent and velocity problems to introduce the derivative, which is the central idea in differential calculus. In much the same way, this chapter starts with the area and distance problems and uses them to formulate the idea of a deinite integral, which is the basic concept of integral calculus. We will see in Chapters 6 and 8 how to use the integral to solve problems concerning volumes, lengths of curves, population predictions, cardiac output, forces on a dam, work, consumer surplus, and baseball, among many others. There is a connection between integral calculus and differential calculus. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus relates the integral to the derivative, and we will see in this chapter that it greatly simpliies the solution of many problems. 5 JRC, Inc. / Alamy Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The Area Problem We begin by attempting to solve the area problem: Find the area of the region S that lies under the curve y - f s xd from a to b. This means that S, illustrated in Figure 1, is bounded by the graph of a continuous function f [where f s xd > 0], the vertical lines x - a and x - b, and the x-axis. In trying to solve the area problem we have to ask ourselves: What is the meaning of the word area? This question is easy to answer for regions with straight sides. For a rectangle, the area is deined as the product of the length and the width. The area of a triangle is half the base times the height. The area of a polygon is found by dividing it into triangles (as in Figure 2) and adding the areas of the triangles. h b A= bh A=A¡+A™+A£+A¢ A=lw l w 1 2 A¡ A™ A£ A¢ However, it isn’t so easy to ind the area of a region with curved sides. We all have an intuitive idea of what the area of a region is. But part of the area problem is to make this intuitive idea precise by giving an exact deinition of area. Recall that in deining a tangent we irst approximated the slope of the tangent line by slopes of secant lines and then we took the limit of these approximations. We pursue a similar idea for areas. We irst approximate the region S by rectangles and then we take the limit of the areas of these rectangles as we increase the number of rectangles. The follow ing example illustrates the procedure. EXAMPLE 1 Use rectangles to estimate the area under the parabola y - x 2 from 0 to 1 (the parabolic region S illustrated in Figure 3). SOLUTION We first notice that the area of S must be somewhere between 0 and 1 because S is contained in a square with side length 1, but we can certainly do better than that. Suppose we divide S into four strips S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , and S 4 by drawing the vertical lines x - 1 4 , x - 1 2 , and x - 3 4 as in Figure 4(a).

","SECTION 5.1 Areas and Distances 367 We can approximate each strip by a rectangle that has the same base as the strip and whose height is the same as the right edge of the strip [see Figure 4(b)]. In other words, the heights of these rectangles are the values of the function f s xd - x 2 at the right end- points of the subintervals f0, 1 4 g, f 1 4 , 1 2 g, f 1 2 , 3 4 g, and f 3 4 , 1g. Each rectangle has width 1 4 and the heights are ( 1 4 ) 2 , ( 1 2 ) 2 , ( 3 4 ) 2 , and 1 2 . If we let R 4 be the sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles, we get R 4 - 1 4 ?

( 3 4 ) 2 1 1 4 ? 1 2 - 15 32 - 0.46875 From Figure 4(b) we see that the area A of S is less than R 4 , so A , 0.46875 Instead of using the rectangles in Figure 4(b) we could use the smaller rectangles in Figure 5 whose heights are the values of f at the left endpoints of the subintervals. (The leftmost rectangle has collapsed because its height is 0.) The sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles is L 4 - 1 4 ? 0 2 1 1 4 ? ( 1 4 ) 2 1 1 4 ? ( 1 2 ) 2 1 1 4 ? ( 3 4 ) 2 - 7 32 - 0.21875 We see that the area of S is larger than L 4 , so we have lower and upper estimates for A: 0.21875 , A , 0.46875 We can repeat this procedure with a larger number of strips.

We could obtain better estimates by increasing the number of strips. The table at the left shows the results of similar calculations (with a computer) using n rectangles whose heights are found with left endpoints sL n d or right endpoints sR n d. In particular, we see by using 50 strips that the area lies between 0.3234 and 0.3434. With 1000 strips we narrow it down even more: A lies between 0.3328335 and 0.3338335. A good estimate is obtained by averaging these numbers: A < 0.3333335. ■ 0 y x 1 (1, 1) 3 4 1 2 1 4 y=≈ FIGURE 5 FIGURE 6 Approximating S with eight rectangles n L n R n 10 0.2850000 0.3850000 20 0.3087500 0.3587500 30 0.3168519 0.3501852 50 0.3234000 0.3434000 100 0.3283500 0.3383500 1000 0.3328335 0.3338335 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In particular, we know that lim n l` 1 n - 0 When we write lim n l` Rn - 1 3 we mean that we can make Rn as close to 1 3 as we like by taking n suficiently large. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

We call the numbers x 1 * , x 2 * , . . . , x n * the sample points. Figure 13 shows approximating rectangles when the sample points are not chosen to be endpoints.

We saw in Examples 1 and 2, for instance, that the area s A - 1 3 d is trapped between all the left approximating sums L n and all the right approximating sums R n . The function in those examples, f s xd - x 2 , happens to be increasing on f0, 1g and so the lower sums arise from left endpoints and the upper sums from right endpoints. (See Figures 8 and 9.) In general, we form lower (and upper) sums by choosing the sample points x i * so that f s x i * d is the minimum (and maximum) value of f on the ith subinterval.

(In a sense this is the inverse problem of the velocity problem that we discussed in Section 2.1.) If the velocity remains constant, then the distance problem is easy to solve by means of the formula distance - velocity 3 time But if the velocity varies, it’ s not so easy to ind the distance traveled. We investigate the problem in the following example. EXAMPLE 4 Suppose the odometer on our car is broken and we want to estimate the distance driven over a 30-second time interval. We take speedometer readings every ive seconds and record them in the following table: Time (s) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Velocity (miyh) 17 21 24 29 32 31 28 In order to have the time and the velocity in consistent units, let’s convert the velocity readings to feet per second (1 miyh - 5280y3600 ftys): Time (s) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Velocity (ftys) 25 31 35 43 47 45 41 During the irst ive seconds the velocity doesn’t change very much, so we can estimate the distance traveled during that time by assuming that the velocity is constant.

","374 CHAPTER 5 Integrals take the velocity during that time interval to be the initial velocity (25 ftys), then we obtain the approximate distance traveled during the irst ive seconds: 25 fty s 3 5 s - 125 ft Similarly, during the second time interval the velocity is approximately constant and we take it to be the velocity when t - 5 s. So our estimate for the distance traveled from t - 5 s to t - 10 s is 31 fty s 3 5 s - 155 ft If we add similar estimates for the other time intervals, we obtain an estimate for the total distance traveled: s25 3 5d 1 s31 3 5d 1 s35 3 5d 1 s43 3 5d 1 s47 3 5d 1 s45 3 5d - 1130 ft We could just as well have used the velocity at the end of each time period instead of the velocity at the beginning as our assumed constant velocity.

The similarity is explained when we sketch a graph of the velocity func- tion of the car in Figure 17 and draw rectangles whose heights are the initial velocities for each time interval. The area of the first rectangle is 25 3 5 - 125, which is also our estimate for the distance traveled in the first five seconds. In fact, the area of each rectangle can be interpreted as a distance because the height represents velocity and the width represents time. The sum of the areas of the rectangles in Figure 17 is L 6 - 1130, which is our initial estimate for the total distance traveled. In general, suppose an object moves with velocity v - f std, where a < t < b and f std > 0 (so the object always moves in the positive direction). We take velocity read- ings at times t 0 s- ad, t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t n s- bd so that the velocity is approximately constant on each subinterval. If these times are equally spaced, then the time between consecutive readings is Dt - sb 2 adyn. During the first time interval the velocity is approximately f st 0 d and so the distance traveled is approximately f st 0 d Dt. Similarly, the distance trav- eled during the second time interval is about f st 1 d Dt and the total distance traveled dur- ing the time interval fa, bg is approximately f st 0 d Dt 1 f st 1 d Dt 1 ∙∙∙ 1 f st n21 d Dt - o n i-1 f st i21 d Dt If we use the velocity at right endpoints instead of left endpoints, our estimate for the total distance becomes f st 1 d Dt 1 f st 2 d Dt 1 ∙∙∙ 1 f st n d Dt - o n i-1 f st i d Dt The more frequently we measure the velocity, the more accurate our estimates become, 10 20 20 40 30 0 √ t FIGURE 17 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Because Equation 5 has the same form as our expressions for area in Equations 2 and 3, it follows that the distance traveled is equal to the area under the graph of the velocity function. In Chapter 6 we will see that other quantities of interest in the natural and social sciences—such as the work done by a variable force or the cardiac output of the heart—can also be interpreted as the area under a curve.

Compute the sum of the areas of approximating rect- angles using equal subintervals and right endpoints for n - 10, 30, 50, and 100. Then guess the value of the exact area. 9. The region under y - x 4 from 0 to 1 10. The region under y - cos x from 0 to y2 11. Some computer algebra systems have commands that will draw approximating rectangles and evaluate the sums of their areas, at least if x i * is a left or right endpoint. (For instance, in Maple use leftbox, rightbox, left- sum, and rightsum.) (a) If f s xd - 1ys x 2 1 1d, 0 < x < 1, ind the left and right sums for n - 10, 30, and 50.

[Hint: Use Equation 3.3.2 on page 191.] We saw in Section 5.1 that a limit of the form lim n l ` o n i-1 f s x i * d Dx - lim n l ` f f s x 1 * d Dx 1 f s x 2 * d Dx 1 ∙∙∙ 1 f s x n * d Dxg arises when we compute an area. We also saw that it arises when we try to ind the dis- tance traveled by an object. It turns out that this same type of limit occurs in a wide vari- ety of situations even when f is not necessarily a positive function. In Chapters 6 and 8 we will see that limits of the form (1) also arise in inding lengths of curves, volumes of solids, centers of mass, force due to water pressure, and work, as well as other quantities. We therefore give this type of limit a special name and notation. 2 Deinition of a Deinite Integral If f is a function deined for a < x < b, we divide the interval fa, bg into n subintervals of equal width Dx - sb 2 adyn. We let x 0 s- ad, x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n s - bd be the endpoints of these subintervals and we let x 1 * , x 2 * , . . . , x n * be any sample points in these subintervals, so x i * lies in the i th subinterval f x i21 , x i g. Then the deinite integral of f from a to b is y b a f s xd dx - lim n l` o n i-1 f s x i * d Dx provided that this limit exists and gives the same value for all possible choices of sample points. If it does exist, we say that f is integrable on fa, bg. The precise meaning of the limit that defines the integral is as follows: For every number «. 0 there is an integer N such that Z y b a f s xd dx 2 o n i-1 f s x i *d Dx Z ,« for every integer n . N and for every choice of xi * in f xi21, xi g. NOTE 1 The symbol y was introduced by Leibniz and is called an integral sign. It is an elongated S and was chosen because an integral is a limit of sums. In the notation 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 5.2 The Deinite Integral 379 y b a f s xd dx, f s xd is called the integrand and a and b are called the limits of integration; a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit. For now, the symbol dx has no meaning by itself; y b a f s xd dx is all one symbol. The dx simply indicates that the independent variable is x. The procedure of calculating an integral is called integration. NOTE 2 The deinite integral y b a f s xd dx is a number; it does not depend on x. In fact, we could use any letter in place of x without changing the value of the integral: y b a f s xd dx - y b a f std dt - y b a f srd dr NOTE 3 The sum o n i-1 f s x i * d Dx that occurs in Deinition 2 is called a Riemann sum after the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann (1826 –1866). So Deinition 2 says that the deinite integral of an integrable function can be approximated to within any desired degree of accuracy by a Riemann sum. We know that if f happens to be positive, then the Riemann sum can be interpreted as a sum of areas of approximating rectangles (see Figure 1). By comparing Deinition 2 with the deinition of area in Section 5.1, we see that the deinite integral y b a f s xd dx can be interpreted as the area under the curve y - f s xd from a to b. (See Figure 2.) x i * 0 y x a Îx y=ƒ 0 y x a b b FIGURE 1 If f s xd > 0, the Riemann sum o f s x i *d Dx is the sum of areas of rectangles. FIGURE 2 If f s xd > 0, the integral y b a f s xd dx is the area under the curve y - f s xd from a to b. If f takes on both positive and negative values, as in Figure 3, then the Riemann sum is the sum of the areas of the rectangles that lie above the x-axis and the negatives of the areas of the rectangles that lie below the x-axis (the areas of the blue rectangles minus the areas of the gold rectangles). When we take the limit of such Riemann sums, we get the situation illustrated in Figure 4. A deinite integral can be interpreted as a net area, that is, a difference of areas: y b a f s xd dx - A 1 2 A 2 where A 1 is the area of the region above the x-axis and below the graph of f , and A 2 is the area of the region below the x-axis and above the graph of f . NOTE 4 Although we have deined y b a f s xd dx by dividing fa, bg into subintervals of equal width, there are situations in which it is advantageous to work with subintervals of unequal width. For instance, in Exercise 5.1.16, NASA provided velocity data at times that were not equally spaced, but we were still able to estimate the distance traveled. And there are methods for numerical integration that take advantage of unequal subintervals. Riemann Bernhard Riemann received his Ph.D. under the direction of the legendary Gauss at the University of Göttingen and remained there to teach. Gauss, who was not in the habit of praising other mathematicians, spoke of Riemann’s “creative, active, truly mathematical mind and gloriously fertile originality.” The deinition (2) of an integral that we use is due to Riemann. He also made major contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable, math- ematical physics, number theory, and the foundations of geometry. Riemann’s broad concept of space and geometry turned out to be the right setting, 50 years later, for Einstein’s general rela- tivity theory. Riemann’s health was poor throughout his life, and he died of tuberculosis at the age of 39. 0 y=ƒ y a b x FIGURE 3 o f s x i *d Dx is an approximation to the net area. y=ƒ y x a b 0 FIGURE 4 y b a f s xd dx is the net area.

","380 CHAPTER 5 Integrals If the subinterval widths are Dx 1 , Dx 2 , . . . , Dx n , we have to ensure that all these widths approach 0 in the limiting process. This happens if the largest width, max Dx i , approaches 0. So in this case the deinition of a deinite integral becomes y b a f s xd dx - lim max Dx i l0 o n i-1 f s x i * d Dx i NOTE 5 We have deined the deinite integral for an integrable function, but not all functions are integrable (see Exercises 71–72). The following theorem shows that the most commonly occurring functions are in fact integrable. The theorem is proved in more advanced courses. 3 Theorem If f is continuous on fa, bg, or if f has only a inite number of jump discontinuities, then f is integrable on fa, bg; that is, the deinite integral y b a f s xd dx exists. If f is integrable on fa, bg, then the limit in Deinition 2 exists and gives the same value no matter how we choose the sample points x i * . To simplify the calculation of the integral we often take the sample points to be right endpoints. Then x i * - x i and the dei- nition of an integral simpliies as follows. 4 Theorem If f is integrable on fa, bg, then y b a f s xd dx - lim nl` o n i-1 f s x i d Dx where Dx - b 2 a n and x i - a 1 i Dx EXAMPLE 1 Express lim n l` o n i-1 s x i 3 1 x i sin x i d Dx as an integral on the interval f0, g. SOLUTION Comparing the given limit with the limit in Theorem 4, we see that they will be identical if we choose f s xd - x 3 1 x sin x. We are given that a - 0 and b - . Therefore, by Theorem 4, we have lim n l ` o n i-1 s x i 3 1 x i sin x i d Dx - y  0 s x 3 1 x sin xd dx ■ Later, when we apply the deinite integral to physical situations, it will be important to recognize limits of sums as integrals, as we did in Example 1. When Leibniz chose the notation for an integral, he chose the ingredients as reminders of the limiting process. In Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(a) y 1 0 s1 2 x 2 dx (b) y 3 0 s x 2 1d dx SOLUTION (a) Since f s xd - s1 2 x 2 > 0, we can interpret this integral as the area under the curve y - s1 2 x 2 from 0 to 1. But, since y 2 - 1 2 x 2 , we get x 2 1 y 2 - 1, which shows that the graph of f is the quarter-circle with radius 1 in Figure 9. Therefore y 1 0 s1 2 x 2 dx - 1 4  s1d 2 -  4 (In Section 7.3 we will be able to prove that the area of a circle of radius r is r 2 .) (b) The graph of y - x 2 1 is the line with slope 1 shown in Figure 10. We compute the integral as the difference of the areas of the two triangles: y 3 0 s x 2 1d dx - A 1 2 A 2 - 1 2 s2 ∙ 2d 2 1 2 s1 ∙ 1d - 1.5 ■ The Midpoint Rule We often choose the sample point x i * to be the right endpoint of the ith subinterval because it is convenient for computing the limit. But if the purpose is to ind an approxi- mation to an integral, it is usually better to choose x i * to be the midpoint of the interval, which we denote by x i . Any Riemann sum is an approximation to an integral, but if we use midpoints we get the following approximation. Midpoint Rule y b a f s xd dx < o n i-1 f sx i d Dx - Dx f f sx 1 d 1 ∙∙∙ 1 f sx n dg where Dx - b 2 a n and x i - 1 2 s x i21 1 x i d - midpoint of f x i21 , x i g TEC Module 5.2 / 7.7 shows how the Midpoint Rule estimates improve as n increases.

","SECTION 5.2 The Deinite Integral 385 mation given by the Midpoint Rule is the sum of the areas of the rectangles shown in Figure 11. ■ At the moment we don’t know how accurate the approximation in Example 5 is, but in Section 7.7 we will learn a method for estimating the error involved in using the Midpoint Rule. At that time we will discuss other methods for approximating definite integrals. If we apply the Midpoint Rule to the integral in Example 2, we get the picture in Fig- ure 12. The approximation M 40 < 26.7563 is much closer to the true value 26.75 than the right endpoint approximation, R 40 < 26.3998, shown in Figure 7. 0 y 3 x 5 y=˛-6x Properties of the Definite Integral When we defined the definite integral y b a f s xd dx, we implicitly assumed that a , b. But the definition as a limit of Riemann sums makes sense even if a . b. Notice that if we reverse a and b, then Dx changes from sb 2 adyn to sa 2 bdyn. Therefore y a b f s xd dx - 2 y b a f s xd dx If a - b, then Dx - 0 and so y a a f s xd dx - 0 We now develop some basic properties of integrals that will help us to evaluate inte- grals in a simple manner. We assume that f and t are continuous functions.

","386 CHAPTER 5 Integrals Property 1 says that the integral of a constant function f s xd - c is the constant times the length of the interval. If c . 0 and a , b, this is to be expected because csb 2 ad is the area of the shaded rectangle in Figure 13. 0 y x a b c y=c area=c(b-a) Property 2 says that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. For positive functions it says that the area under f 1 t is the area under f plus the area under t. Figure 14 helps us understand why this is true: In view of how graphical addition works, the corresponding vertical line segments have equal height. In general, Property 2 follows from Theorem 4 and the fact that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits: y b a f f s xd 1 ts xdg dx - lim n l ` o n i-1 f f s x i d 1 ts x i dg Dx - lim n l ` F o n i-1 f s x i d Dx 1 o n i-1 ts x i d Dx G - lim n l ` o n i-1 f s x i d Dx 1 lim n l ` o n i-1 ts x i d Dx - y b a f s xd dx 1 y b a ts xd dx Property 3 can be proved in a similar manner and says that the integral of a constant times a function is the constant times the integral of the function. In other words, a con- stant (but only a constant) can be taken in front of an integral sign. Property 4 is proved by writing f 2 t - f 1 s2td and using Properties 2 and 3 with c - 21. EXAMPLE 6 Use the properties of integrals to evaluate y 1 0 s4 1 3x 2 d dx. SOLUTION Using Properties 2 and 3 of integrals, we have y 1 0 s4 1 3x 2 d dx - y 1 0 4 dx 1 y 1 0 3x 2 dx - y 1 0 4 dx 1 3 y 1 0 x 2 dx We know from Property 1 that y 1 0 4 dx - 4s1 2 0d - 4 and we found in Example 5.1.2 that y 1 0 x 2 dx - 1 3 . So y 1 0 s4 1 3x 2 d dx - y 1 0 4 dx 1 3 y 1 0 x 2 dx - 4 1 3 ∙ 1 3 - 5 ■ The next property tells us how to combine integrals of the same function over adjacent intervals. FIGURE 13 y b a c dx - c sb 2 ad y 0 x a b f g f+g FIGURE 14 y b a f f sxd 1 ts xdg dx - y b a f sxd dx 1 y b a t sxd dx Property 3 seems intuitively reasonable because we know that multiplying a function by a positive number c stretches or shrinks its graph vertically by a factor of c. So it stretches or shrinks each approximating rectangle by a factor c and therefore it has the effect of multiplying the area by c. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 5.2 The Deinite Integral 387 5. y c a f s xd dx 1 y b c f s xd dx - y b a f s xd dx This is not easy to prove in general, but for the case where f s xd > 0 and a , c , b Property 5 can be seen from the geometric interpretation in Figure 15: the area under y - f s xd from a to c plus the area from c to b is equal to the total area from a to b. EXAMPLE 7 If it is known that y 10 0 f s xd dx - 17 and y 8 0 f s xd dx - 12, ind y 10 8 f s xd dx . SOLUTION By Property 5, we have y 8 0 f s xd dx 1 y 10 8 f s xd dx - y 10 0 f s xd dx so y 10 8 f s xd dx - y 10 0 f s xd dx 2 y 8 0 f s xd dx - 17 2 12 - 5 ■ Properties 1–5 are true whether a , b, a - b, or a . b. The following properties, in which we compare sizes of functions and sizes of integrals, are true only if a < b. Comparison Properties of the Integral 6. If f s xd > 0 for a < x < b, then y b a f s xd dx > 0. 7. If f s xd > ts xd for a < x < b, then y b a f s xd dx > y b a ts xd dx. 8. If m < f s xd < M for a < x < b, then msb 2 ad < y b a f s xd dx < Msb 2 ad If f s xd > 0, then y b a f s xd dx represents the area under the graph of f , so the geometric interpretation of Property 6 is simply that areas are positive. (It also follows directly from the deinition because all the quantities involved are positive.) Property 7 says that a big- ger function has a bigger integral. It follows from Properties 6 and 4 because f 2 t > 0. Property 8 is illustrated by Figure 16 for the case where f s xd > 0. If f is continuous, we could take m and M to be the absolute minimum and maximum values of f on the interval fa, bg. In this case Property 8 says that the area under the graph of f is greater than the area of the rectangle with height m and less than the area of the rectangle with height M. PROOF OF PROPERTY 8 Since m < f s xd < M, Property 7 gives y b a m dx < y b a f s xd dx < y b a M dx Using Property 1 to evaluate the integrals on the left and right sides, we obtain msb 2 ad < y b a f s xd dx < Msb 2 ad ■ Property 8 is useful when all we want is a rough estimate of the size of an integral without going to the bother of using the Midpoint Rule. 0 y x a b c y=ƒ FIGURE 15 0 y m M x a b y=ƒ FIGURE 16 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","388 CHAPTER 5 Integrals EXAMPLE 8 Use Property 8 to estimate y 1 0 e 2x 2 dx. SOLUTION Because f s xd - e 2x 2 is a decreasing function on f0, 1g , its absolute maxi- mum value is M - f s0d - 1 and its absolute minimum value is m - f s1d - e 21 . Thus, by Property 8, e 21 s1 2 0d < y 1 0 e 2x 2 dx < 1s1 2 0d or e 21 < y 1 0 e 2x 2 dx < 1 Since e 21 < 0.3679, we can write 0.367 < y 1 0 e 2x 2 dx < 1 ■ The result of Example 8 is illustrated in Figure 17.

","392 CHAPTER 5 Integrals The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is appropriately named because it establishes a connection between the two branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus arose from the tangent problem, whereas integral calcu- lus arose from a seemingly unrelated problem, the area problem. Newton’s mentor at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow (1630 –1677), discovered that these two problems are actu- ally closely related. In fact, he realized that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives the precise inverse relationship between the derivative and the integral. It was Newton and Leibniz who exploited this relationship and used it to develop calculus into a systematic mathematical method. In particular, they saw that the Fundamental Theorem enabled them to compute areas and integrals very easily without having to compute them as limits of sums as we did in Sec- tions 5.1 and 5.2. The first part of the Fundamental Theorem deals with functions defined by an equa- tion of the form ts xd - y x a f std dt where f is a continuous function on fa, bg and x varies between a and b. Observe that t depends only on x, which appears as the variable upper limit in the integral. If x is a fixed number, then the integral y x a f std dt is a definite number. If we then let x vary, the number y x a f std dt also varies and defines a function of x denoted by ts xd. If f happens to be a positive function, then ts xd can be interpreted as the area under the graph of f from a to x, where x can vary from a to b. (Think of t as the “area so far” function; see Figure 1.) EXAMPLE 1 If f is the function whose graph is shown in Figure 2 and ts xd - y x 0 f std dt, find the values of ts0d, ts1d, ts2d, ts3d, ts4d, and ts5d. Then sketch a rough graph of t. SOLUTION First we notice that ts0d - y 0 0 f std dt - 0. From Figure 3 we see that ts1d is the area of a triangle: ts1d - y 1 0 f std dt - 1 2 s1 ? 2d - 1 1 0 y t a b x area=© y=f(t) FIGURE 1 t 0 1 1 2 2 4 2 y y=f(t) FIGURE 2 of x at which ts xd starts to decrease. [Unlike the integral in Problem 2, it is impossible to evaluate the integral defining t to obtain an explicit expression for ts xd.] (c) Use the integration command on your calculator or computer to estimate ts0.2d, ts0.4d, ts0.6d, . . . , ts1.8d, ts2d. Then use these values to sketch a graph of t. (d) Use your graph of t from part (c) to sketch the graph of t9 using the interpretation of t9 s xd as the slope of a tangent line. How does the graph of t9 compare with the graph of f ? 4. Suppose f is a continuous function on the interval fa, bg and we define a new function t by the equation ts xd - y x a f std dt Based on your results in Problems 1–3, conjecture an expression for t9 s xd.

Notice that, because f s t d is positive for t , 3, we keep adding area for t , 3 and so t is increasing up to x - 3, where it attains a maximum value. For x . 3, t decreases because f s t d is negative. ■ If we take f s t d - t and a - 0, then, using Exercise 5.2.27, we have ts xd - y x 0 t dt - x 2 2 Notice that t9 s xd - x, that is, t9 - f . In other words, if t is deined as the integral of f by Equation 1, then t turns out to be an antiderivative of f , at least in this case. And if we sketch the derivative of the function t shown in Figure 4 by estimating slopes of tangents, we get a graph like that of f in Figure 2. So we suspect that t9 - f in Example 1 too. To see why this might be generally true we consider any continuous function f with f s xd > 0. Then ts xd - y x a f std dt can be interpreted as the area under the graph of f from a to x, as in Figure 1. In order to compute t9 s xd from the deinition of a derivative we irst observe that, for h . 0, ts x 1 hd 2 ts xd is obtained by subtracting areas, so it is the area under the graph of f from x to x 1 h (the blue area in Figure 5). For small h you can see from the igure that this area is approximately equal to the area of the rectangle with height f s xd and width h: ts x 1 hd 2 ts xd< hf s xd so ts x 1 hd 2 ts xd h < f s xd FIGURE 3 FIGURE 4 ts xd - y x 0 f std dt x 0 1 1 2 4 2 y 3 4 5 3 g y 0 t a b x x+h h ƒ FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","394 CHAPTER 5 Integrals Intuitively, we therefore expect that t9 s xd - lim h l0 ts x 1 hd 2 ts xd h - f s xd The fact that this is true, even when f is not necessarily positive, is the irst part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1 If f is continuous on fa, bg, then the function t deined by ts xd - y x a f s t d dt a < x < b is continuous on fa, bg and differentiable on sa, bd, and t9 s xd - f s xd. PROOF If x and x 1 h are in sa, bd, then ts x 1 hd 2 ts xd - y x1h a f s t d dt 2 y x a f s t d dt - Sy x a f s t d dt 1 y x1h x f s t d dt D 2 y x a f s t d dt (by Property 5) - y x1h x f s t d dt and so, for h ± 0, ts x 1 hd 2 ts xd h - 1 h y x1h x f s t d dt For now let’s assume that h . 0. Since f is continuous on fx, x 1 hg, the Extreme Value Theorem says that there are numbers u and v in fx, x 1 hg such that f sud - m and f svd - M, where m and M are the absolute minimum and maximum values of f on fx, x 1 hg. (See Figure 6.) By Property 8 of integrals, we have mh < y x1h x f s t d dt < Mh that is, f sudh < y x1h x f s t d dt < f svdh Since h . 0, we can divide this inequality by h: f sud < 1 h y x1h x f s t d dt < f svd Now we use Equation 2 to replace the middle part of this inequality: f sud < ts x 1 hd 2 ts xd h < f svd Inequality 3 can be proved in a similar manner for the case where h , 0. (See Exer- cise 77.) We abbreviate the name of this theorem as FTC1. In words, it says that the derivative of a definite integral with respect to its upper limit is the inte- grand evaluated at the upper limit. 0 y x x u √=x+h y=ƒ m M FIGURE 6 2 3 TEC Module 5.3 provides visual evidence for FTC1.

Then u l x and v l x, since u and v lie between x and x 1 h. Therefore lim h l0 f sud - lim u lx f sud - f s xd and lim h l0 f svd - lim v lx f svd - f s xd because f is continuous at x. We conclude, from (3) and the Squeeze Theorem, that t9 s xd - lim h l0 ts x 1 hd 2 ts xd h - f s xd If x - a or b, then Equation 4 can be interpreted as a one-sided limit. Then Theo- rem 2.8.4 (modified for one-sided limits) shows that t is continuous on fa, bg. ■ Using Leibniz notation for derivatives, we can write FTC1 as d dx y x a f s t d dt - f s xd when f is continuous. Roughly speaking, Equation 5 says that if we first integrate f and then differentiate the result, we get back to the original function f . EXAMPLE 2 Find the derivative of the function ts xd - y x 0 s1 1 t 2 dt. SOLUTION Since f s t d - s1 1 t 2 is continuous, Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives t9 s xd - s1 1 x 2 ■ EXAMPLE 3 Although a formula of the form ts xd - y x a f s t d dt may seem like a strange way of defining a function, books on physics, chemistry, and statistics are full of such functions. For instance, the Fresnel function Ss xd - y x 0 sins t 2 y2d dt is named after the French physicist Augustin Fresnel (1788 –1827), who is famous for his works in optics. This function first appeared in Fresnel’s theory of the diffraction of light waves, but more recently it has been applied to the design of highways. Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem tells us how to differentiate the Fresnel function: S9 s xd - sinsx 2 y2d This means that we can apply all the methods of differential calculus to analyze S (see Exercise 71). Figure 7 shows the graphs of f s xd - sinsx 2 y2d and the Fresnel function Ss xd - y x 0 f s t d dt. A computer was used to graph S by computing the value of this inte- gral for many values of x. It does indeed look as if Ss xd is the area under the graph of f from 0 to x [until x < 1.4 when Ss xd becomes a difference of areas]. Figure 8 shows a larger part of the graph of S. If we now start with the graph of S in Figure 7 and think about what its derivative should look like, it seems reasonable that S9 s xd - f s xd. [For instance, S is increasing when f s xd . 0 and decreasing when f s xd , 0.] So this gives a visual confirmation of Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. ■ 4 5 1 0 x 1 y f S FIGURE 7 f s xd - sinsx 2 y2d Ss xd - y x 0 sinst 2 y2d dt y 1 0.5 x FIGURE 8 The Fresnel function Ss xd - y x 0 sinst 2 y2d dt Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

SOLUTION Here we have to be careful to use the Chain Rule in conjunction with FTC1. Let u - x 4 . Then d dx y x 4 1 sec t dt - d dx y u 1 sec t dt - d du Fy u 1 sec t dt G du dx (by the Chain Rule) - sec u du dx (by FTC1) - secs x 4 d ? 4x 3 ■ In Section 5.2 we computed integrals from the deinition as a limit of Riemann sums and we saw that this procedure is sometimes long and dificult. The second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which follows easily from the first part, provides us with a much simpler method for the evaluation of integrals. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 If f is continuous on fa, bg, then y b a f s xd dx - Fsbd 2 Fsad where F is any antiderivative of f, that is, a function such that F9 - f. We abbreviate this theorem as FTC2. PROOF Let ts xd - y x a f s t d dt. We know from Part 1 that t9 s xd - f s xd; that is, t is an antiderivative of f . If F is any other antiderivative of f on fa, bg, then we know from Corollary 4.2.7 that F and t differ by a constant: Fs xd - ts xd 1 C for a , x , b. But both F and t are continuous on fa, bg and so, by taking limits of both sides of Equation 6 (as x l a 1 and x l b 2 ), we see that it also holds when x - a and x - b. So Fs xd - ts xd 1 C for all x in fa, bg. If we put x - a in the formula for ts xd, we get tsad - y a a f s t d dt - 0 So, using Equation 6 with x - b and x - a, we have Fsbd 2 Fsad - f tsbd 1 C g 2 f tsad 1 C g - tsbd 2 tsad - tsbd - y b a f s t d dt ■ Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem states that if we know an antiderivative F of f, then we can evaluate y b a f s xd dx simply by subtracting the values of F at the endpoints of the interval fa, bg. It’s very surprising that y b a f s xd dx, which was defined by a com- plicated procedure involving all of the values of f s xd for a < x < b, can be found by knowing the values of Fs xd at only two points, a and b. 6 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 5.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 397 Although the theorem may be surprising at irst glance, it becomes plausible if we interpret it in physical terms. If vs t d is the velocity of an object and ss t d is its position at time t, then vs t d - s9 s t d, so s is an antiderivative of v. In Section 5.1 we considered an object that always moves in the positive direction and made the guess that the area under the velocity curve is equal to the distance traveled. In symbols: y b a vstd dt - ssbd 2 ssad That is exactly what FTC2 says in this context. EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate the integral y 3 1 e x dx. SOLUTION The function f s xd - e x is continuous everywhere and we know that an anti- derivative is Fs xd - e x , so Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem gives y 3 1 e x dx - Fs3d 2 Fs1d - e 3 2 e Notice that FTC2 says we can use any antiderivative F of f. So we may as well use the simplest one, namely Fs xd - e x , instead of e x 1 7 or e x 1 C. ■ We often use the notation Fs xdg a b - Fsbd 2 Fsad So the equation of FTC2 can be written as y b a f s xd dx - Fs xdg a b where F9 - f Other common notations are Fs xd | a b and fFs xdg a b . EXAMPLE 6 Find the area under the parabola y - x 2 from 0 to 1. SOLUTION An antiderivative of f s xd - x 2 is Fs xd - 1 3 x 3 . The required area A is found using Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem: A - y 1 0 x 2 dx - x 3 3 G 0 1 - 1 3 3 2 0 3 3 - 1 3 ■ If you compare the calculation in Example 6 with the one in Example 5.1.2, you will see that the Fundamental Theorem gives a much shorter method. EXAMPLE 7 Evaluate y 6 3 dx x . SOLUTION The given integral is an abbreviation for y 6 3 1 x dx An antiderivative of f s xd - 1 yx is Fs xd - ln | x | and, because 3 < x < 6, we can write Fs xd - ln x. So y 6 3 1 x dx - ln xg 6 3 - ln 6 2 ln 3 - ln 6 3 - ln 2 ■ Compare the calculation in Example 5 with the much harder one in Example 5.2.3. In applying the Fundamental Theorem we use a particular antiderivative F of f . It is not necessary to use the most general antiderivative. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","398 CHAPTER 5 Integrals EXAMPLE 8 Find the area under the cosine curve from 0 to b, where 0 < b < y2. SOLUTION Since an antiderivative of f s xd - cos x is Fs xd - sin x, we have A - y b 0 cos xdx - sin xg b 0 - sin b 2 sin 0 - sin b In particular, taking b - y2, we have proved that the area under the cosine curve from 0 to y2 is sinsy2d - 1. (See Figure 9.) ■ When the French mathematician Gilles de Roberval irst found the area under the sine and cosine curves in 1635, this was a very challenging problem that required a great deal of ingenuity. If we didn’t have the beneit of the Fundamental Theorem, we would have to compute a difficult limit of sums using obscure trigonometric identities (or a computer algebra system as in Exercise 5.1.31). It was even more difficult for Roberval because the apparatus of limits had not been invented in 1635. But in the 1660s and 1670s, when the Fundamental Theorem was discovered by Barrow and exploited by Newton and Leibniz, such problems became very easy, as you can see from Example 8. EXAMPLE 9 What is wrong with the following calculation? y 3 21 1 x 2 dx - x 21 21 G 3 21 - 2 1 3 2 1 - 2 4 3 SOLUTION To start, we notice that this calculation must be wrong because the answer is negative but f s xd - 1 yx 2 > 0 and Property 6 of integrals says that y b a f s xd dx > 0 when f > 0. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus applies to continuous functions. It can’t be applied here because f s xd - 1 yx 2 is not continuous on f21, 3g. In fact, f has an infinite discontinuity at x - 0, so y 3 21 1 x 2 dx does not exist. ■ Diferentiation and Integration as Inverse Processes We end this section by bringing together the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Suppose f is continuous on fa, bg. 1. If ts xd - y x a f s t d dt, then t9 s xd - f s xd. 2. y b a f s xd dx - Fsbd 2 Fsad, where F is any antiderivative of f , that is, F9 - f. We noted that Part 1 can be rewritten as d dx y x a f s t d dt - f s xd which says that if f is integrated and then the result is differentiated, we arrive back at the original function f . Since F9 s xd - f s xd, Part 2 can be rewritten as y b a F9 s xd dx - Fsbd 2 Fsad y 0 1 x y=cos x area=1 π 2 FIGURE 9 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 5.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 399 This version says that if we take a function F, irst differentiate it, and then integrate the result, we arrive back at the original function F , but in the form Fsbd 2 Fsad. Taken together, the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus say that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. Each undoes what the other does. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is unquestionably the most important theo- rem in calculus and, indeed, it ranks as one of the great accomplishments of the human mind. Before it was discovered, from the time of Eudoxus and Archimedes to the time of Galileo and Fermat, problems of finding areas, volumes, and lengths of curves were so difficult that only a genius could meet the challenge. But now, armed with the systematic method that Newton and Leibniz fashioned out of the Fundamental Theorem, we will see in the chapters to come that these challenging problems are accessible to all of us. 1.

A manufacturing company owns a major piece of equipment that depreciates at the (continuous) rate f - f s t d, where t is the time measured in months since its last overhaul. Because a ixed cost A is incurred each time the machine is overhauled, the company wants to determine the optimal time T (in months) between overhauls.

We saw in Section 5.3 that the second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus pro- vides a very powerful method for evaluating the deinite integral of a function, assuming that we can ind an antiderivative of the function. In this section we introduce a notation for antiderivatives, review the formulas for antiderivatives, and use them to evaluate dei- nite integrals. We also reformulate FTC2 in a way that makes it easier to apply to science and engineering problems. Indeinite Integrals Both parts of the Fundamental Theorem establish connections between antiderivatives and deinite integrals. Part 1 says that if f is continuous, then y x a f std dt is an antiderivative of f . Part 2 says that y b a f s xd dx can be found by evaluating Fsbd 2 Fsad, where F is an antiderivative of f . We need a convenient notation for antiderivatives that makes them easy to work with.

","SECTION 5.4 Indeinite Integrals and the Net Change Theorem 403 Theorem, the notation y f s xd dx is traditionally used for an antiderivative of f and is called an indeinite integral. Thus y f s xd dx - Fs xd means F9 s xd - f s xd For example, we can write y x 2 dx - x 3 3 1 C because d dx S x 3 3 1 C D - x 2 So we can regard an indeinite integral as representing an entire family of functions (one antiderivative for each value of the constant C ). You should distinguish carefully between deinite and indeinite integrals. A deinite integral y b a f s xd dx is a number, whereas an indeinite integral y f s xd dx is a function (or family of functions). The connection between them is given by Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem: If f is continuous on fa, bg, then y b a f s xd dx - y f s xd dxg a b The effectiveness of the Fundamental Theorem depends on having a supply of anti- derivatives of functions. We therefore restate the Table of Antidifferentiation Formulas from Section 4.9, together with a few others, in the notation of indeinite integrals. Any formula can be veriied by differentiating the function on the right side and obtaining the integrand. For instance, y sec 2 xdx - tan x 1 C because d dx stan x 1 C d - sec 2 x y cf s xd dx - c y f s xd dx y f f s xd 1 ts xdg dx - y f s xd dx 1 y ts xd dx y kdx - kx 1 C y x n dx - x n11 n 1 1 1 C sn ± 21d y 1 x dx - ln | x | 1 C y e x dx - e x 1 C y b x dx - b x ln b 1 C y sin xdx - 2cos x 1 C y cos xdx - sin x 1 C y sec 2 xdx - tan x 1 C y csc 2 xdx - 2cot x 1 C y sec x tan xdx - sec x 1 C y csc x cot xdx - 2csc x 1 C y 1 x 2 1 1 dx - tan 21 x 1 C y 1 s1 2 x 2 dx - sin 21 x 1 C y sinh x dx - cosh x 1 C y cosh x dx - sinh x 1 C 1 Table of Indeinite Integrals Recall from Theorem 4.9.1 that the most general antiderivative on a given interval is obtained by adding a constant to a particular antiderivative.

","404 CHAPTER 5 Integrals that when a formula for a general indeinite integral is given, it is valid only on an interval. Thus we write y 1 x 2 dx - 2 1 x 1 C with the understanding that it is valid on the interval s0, `d or on the interval s2`, 0d . This is true despite the fact that the general antiderivative of the function f s xd - 1 yx 2 , x ± 0, is Fs xd - 2 1 x 1 C 1 if x , 0 2 1 x 1 C 2 if x . 0 EXAMPLE 1 Find the general indeinite integral y s10x 4 2 2 sec 2 xd dx SOLUTION Using our convention and Table 1, we have y s10x 4 2 2 sec 2 xd dx - 10 y x 4 dx 2 2 y sec 2 xdx - 10 x 5 5 2 2 tan x 1 C - 2x 5 2 2 tan x 1 C You should check this answer by differentiating it. ■ EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate y cos  sin 2  d.

This means that F9 - f , so the equation can be rewrit- ten as y b a F9 s xd dx - Fsbd 2 Fsad We know that F9 s xd represents the rate of change of y - Fs xd with respect to x and Fsbd 2 Fsad is the change in y when x changes from a to b. [Note that y could, for instance, increase, then decrease, then increase again. Although y might change in both Figure 2 shows the graph of the inte- grand in Example 4.

","406 CHAPTER 5 Integrals directions, Fsbd 2 Fsad represents the net change in y.] So we can reformulate FTC2 in words as follows. Net Change Theorem The integral of a rate of change is the net change: y b a F9 s xd dx - Fsbd 2 Fsad This principle can be applied to all of the rates of change in the natural and social sci- ences that we discussed in Section 3.7. Here are a few instances of this idea: ● If Vstd is the volume of water in a reservoir at time t, then its derivative V9 std is the rate at which water lows into the reservoir at time t. So y t 2 t 1 V9 s t d dt - Vs t 2 d 2 Vs t 1 d is the change in the amount of water in the reservoir between time t 1 and time t 2 . ● If fCgstd is the concentration of the product of a chemical reaction at time t, then the rate of reaction is the derivative d fCgydt. So y t 2 t 1 d fCg dt dt - fCgst 2 d 2 fCgst 1 d is the change in the concentration of C from time t 1 to time t 2 . ● If the mass of a rod measured from the left end to a point x is ms xd, then the linear density is s xd - m9 s xd. So y b a s xd dx - msbd 2 msad is the mass of the segment of the rod that lies between x - a and x - b. ● If the rate of growth of a population is dny dt, then y t 2 t 1 dn dt dt - nst 2 d 2 nst 1 d is the net change in population during the time period from t 1 to t 2 . (The popu- lation increases when births happen and decreases when deaths occur. The net change takes into account both births and deaths.) ● If Cs xd is the cost of producing x units of a commodity, then the marginal cost is the derivative C9 s xd. So y x 2 x 1 C9 s xd dx - Cs x 2 d 2 Cs x 1 d is the increase in cost when production is increased from x 1 units to x 2 units. ● If an object moves along a straight line with position function sstd, then its veloc- ity is vstd - s9 std, so y t 2 t 1 vstd dt - sst 2 d 2 sst 1 d is the net change of position, or displacement, of the particle during the time period from t 1 to t 2 .

","SECTION 5.4 Indeinite Integrals and the Net Change Theorem 407 where the object moves in the positive direction, but now we have proved that it is always true. ● If we want to calculate the distance the object travels during the time interval, we have to consider the intervals when vstd > 0 (the particle moves to the right) and also the intervals when vstd < 0 (the particle moves to the left). In both cases the distance is computed by integrating | vstd | , the speed. Therefore y t 2 t 1 | vstd | dt - total distance traveled Figure 3 shows how both displacement and distance traveled can be interpreted in terms of areas under a velocity curve. displacement - y t 2 t 1 v std dt - A 1 2 A 2 1 A 3 distance - y t 2 t 1 | v std | dt - A 1 1 A 2 1 A 3 ● The acceleration of the object is astd - v9 std, so y t 2 t 1 astd dt - vst 2 d 2 vst 1 d is the change in velocity from time t 1 to time t 2 . EXAMPLE 6 A particle moves along a line so that its velocity at time t is vstd - t 2 2 t 2 6 (measured in meters per second). (a) Find the displacement of the particle during the time period 1 < t < 4. (b) Find the distance traveled during this time period. SOLUTION (a) By Equation 2, the displacement is ss4d 2 ss1d - y 4 1 vstd dt - y 4 1 st 2 2 t 2 6d dt - F t 3 3 2 t 2 2 2 6t G 1 4 - 2 9 2 This means that the particle moved 4.5 m toward the left. (b) Note that vstd - t 2 2 t 2 6 - st 2 3dst 1 2d and so vstd < 0 on the interval f1, 3g and vstd > 0 on f3, 4g.

But we know that the basic ideas behind integration were investigated 2500 years ago by ancient Greeks such as Eudoxus and Archimedes, and methods for inding tangents were pioneered by Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), Isaac Barrow (1630 –1677), and others. Barrow––who taught at Cambridge and was a major inluence on Newton––was the irst to understand the inverse relationship between differentiation and integration. What Newton and Leibniz did was to use this relationship, in the form of the Fundamental Theorem of Calcu- lus, in order to develop calculus into a systematic mathematical discipline. It is in this sense that Newton and Leibniz are credited with the invention of calculus.

Because of the Fundamental Theorem, it’s important to be able to ind antiderivatives. But our antidifferentiation formulas don’t tell us how to evaluate integrals such as y 2x s1 1 x 2 dx To ind this integral we use the problem-solving strategy of introducing something extra. Here the “something extra” is a new variable; we change from the variable x to a new variable u. Suppose that we let u be the quantity under the root sign in (1), u - 1 1 x 2 . Then the differential of u is du - 2xdx. Notice that if the dx in the notation for an inte- 1 PS Differentials were deined in Section 3.10.

","SECTION 5.5 The Substitution Rule 413 gral were to be interpreted as a differential, then the differential 2xdx would occur in (1) and so, formally, without justifying our calculation, we could write y 2x s1 1 x 2 dx - y s1 1 x 2 2xdx - y s u du - 2 3 u 3y2 1 C - 2 3 s1 1 x 2 d 3y2 1 C But now we can check that we have the correct answer by using the Chain Rule to dif- ferentiate the inal function of Equation 2: d dx f 2 3 s1 1 x 2 d 3y2 1 Cg - 2 3 ? 3 2 s1 1 x 2 d 1y2 ? 2x - 2x s1 1 x 2 In general, this method works whenever we have an integral that we can write in the form y f s ts xdd t9 s xd dx. Observe that if F9 - f , then y F9 s ts xdd t9 s xd dx - Fs ts xdd 1 C because, by the Chain Rule, d dx fFs ts xddg - F9 s ts xdd t9 s xd If we make the “change of variable” or “substitution” u - ts xd, then from Equation 3 we have y F9 s ts xdd t9 s xd dx - Fs ts xdd 1 C - Fsud 1 C - y F9 sud du or, writing F9 - f , we get y f s ts xdd t9 s xd dx - y f sud du Thus we have proved the following rule. 4 The Substitution Rule If u - ts xd is a differentiable function whose range is an interval I and f is continuous on I , then y f s ts xdd t9 s xd dx - y f sud du Notice that the Substitution Rule for integration was proved using the Chain Rule for differentiation. Notice also that if u - ts xd, then du - t9 s xd dx, so a way to remember the Substitution Rule is to think of dx and du in (4) as differentials. Thus the Substitution Rule says: It is permissible to operate with dx and du after integral signs as if they were differentials. EXAMPLE 1 Find y x 3 coss x 4 1 2d dx. SOLUTION We make the substitution u - x 4 1 2 because its differential is du - 4x 3 dx, which, apart from the constant factor 4, occurs in the integral.

","414 CHAPTER 5 Integrals x 3 dx - 1 4 du and the Substitution Rule, we have y x 3 coss x 4 1 2d dx - y cos u ? 1 4 du - 1 4 y cos u du - 1 4 sin u 1 C - 1 4 sins x 4 1 2d 1 C Notice that at the inal stage we had to return to the original variable x. ■ The idea behind the Substitution Rule is to replace a relatively complicated integral by a simpler integral. This is accomplished by changing from the original variable x to a new variable u that is a function of x. Thus in Example 1 we replaced the integral y x 3 coss x 4 1 2d dx by the simpler integral 1 4 y cos u du. The main challenge in using the Substitution Rule is to think of an appropriate substi- tution. You should try to choose u to be some function in the integrand whose differential also occurs (except for a constant factor). This was the case in Example 1. If that is not possible, try choosing u to be some complicated part of the integrand (perhaps the inner function in a composite function). Finding the right substitution is a bit of an art. It’s not unusual to guess wrong; if your irst guess doesn’t work, try another substitution. EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate y s2x 1 1 dx. SOLUTION 1 Let u - 2x 1 1. Then du - 2 dx, so dx - 1 2 du. Thus the Substitution Rule gives y s2x 1 1 dx - y su ? 1 2 du - 1 2 y u 1y2 du - 1 2 ? u 3y2 3 y2 1 C - 1 3 u 3y2 1 C - 1 3 s2x 1 1d 3y2 1 C SOLUTION 2 Another possible substitution is u - s2x 1 1 . Then du - dx s2x 1 1 so dx - s2x 1 1 du - u du (Or observe that u 2 - 2x 1 1, so 2u du - 2 dx.) Therefore y s2x 1 1 dx - y u ? u du - y u 2 du - u 3 3 1 C - 1 3 s2x 1 1d 3y2 1 C ■ EXAMPLE 3 Find y x s1 2 4x 2 dx. SOLUTION Let u - 1 2 4x 2 .

","SECTION 5.5 The Substitution Rule 415 The answer to Example 3 could be checked by differentiation, but instead let’s check it with a graph. In Figure 1 we have used a computer to graph both the integrand f s xd - x ys1 2 4x 2 and its indeinite integral ts xd - 2 1 4 s1 2 4x 2 (we take the case C - 0). Notice that ts xd decreases when f s xd is negative, increases when f s xd is posi- tive, and has its minimum value when f s xd - 0. So it seems reasonable, from the graphi- cal evidence, that t is an antiderivative of f . EXAMPLE 4 Calculate y e 5x dx. SOLUTION If we let u - 5x, then du - 5 dx, so dx - 1 5 du. Therefore y e 5x dx - 1 5 y e u du - 1 5 e u 1 C - 1 5 e 5x 1 C ■ NOTE With some experience, you might be able to evaluate integrals like those in Examples 1– 4 without going to the trouble of making an explicit substitution. By recog- nizing the pattern in Equation 3, where the integrand on the left side is the product of the derivative of an outer function and the derivative of the inner function, we could work Example 1 as follows: y x 3 coss x 4 1 2d dx - y coss x 4 1 2d ? x 3 dx - 1 4 y coss x 4 1 2d ? s4x 3 d dx - 1 4 y coss x 4 1 2d ? d dx s x 4 1 2d dx - 1 4 sins x 4 1 2d 1 C Similarly, the solution to Example 4 could be written like this: y e 5x dx - 1 5 y 5e 5x dx - 1 5 y d dx se 5x d dx - 1 5 e 5x 1 C The following example, however, is more complicated and so an explicit substitution is advisable. EXAMPLE 5 Find y s1 1 x 2 x 5 dx. SOLUTION An appropriate substitution becomes more obvious if we factor x 5 as x 4 ? x. Let u - 1 1 x 2 . Then du - 2xdx, so xdx - 1 2 du. Also x 2 - u 2 1, so x 4 - su 2 1d 2 : y s1 1 x 2 x 5 dx - y s1 1 x 2 x 4 ∙ xdx - y su su 2 1d 2 ? 1 2 du - 1 2 y su su 2 2 2u 1 1d du - 1 2 y su 5y2 2 2u 3y2 1 u 1y2 d du - 1 2 ( 2 7 u 7y2 2 2 ? 2 5 u 5y2 1 2 3 u 3y2 ) 1 C - 1 7 s1 1 x 2 d 7y2 2 2 5 s1 1 x 2 d 5y2 1 1 3 s1 1 x 2 d 3y2 1 C ■ EXAMPLE 6 Calculate y tan xdx.

","416 CHAPTER 5 Integrals This suggests that we should substitute u - cos x, since then du - 2sin x dx and so sin x dx - 2du: y tan xdx - y sin x cos x dx - 2 y 1 u du - 2ln | u | 1 C - 2ln | cos x | 1 C ■ Since 2ln | cos x | - lns | cos x | 21 d - lns1 y | cos x | d - ln | sec x | , the result of Exam- ple 6 can also be written as y tan x dx - ln | sec x | 1 C Definite Integrals When evaluating a deinite integral by substitution, two methods are possible. One method is to evaluate the indeinite integral irst and then use the Fundamental Theorem. For instance, using the result of Example 2, we have y 4 0 s2x 1 1 dx - y s2x 1 1 dx g 0 4 - 1 3 s2x 1 1d 3y2 g 0 4 - 1 3 s9d 3y2 2 1 3 s1d 3y2 - 1 3 s27 2 1d - 26 3 Another method, which is usually preferable, is to change the limits of integration when the variable is changed. 6 This rule says that when using a sub- stitution in a deinite integral, we must put everything in terms of the new variable u, not only x and dx but also the limits of integration. The new limits of integration are the values of u that correspond to x - a and x - b. The Substitution Rule for Deinite Integrals If t9 is continuous on fa, bg and f is continuous on the range of u - ts xd, then y b a f s ts xdd t9 s xd dx - y tsbd tsad f sud du PROOF Let F be an antiderivative of f . Then, by (3), Fs ts xdd is an antiderivative of f s ts xdd t9 s xd, so by Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem, we have y b a f s ts xdd t9 s xd dx - Fs ts xddg b a - Fs tsbdd 2 Fs tsadd But, applying FTC2 a second time, we also have y tsbd tsad f sud du - Fsudg tsad tsbd - Fs tsbdd 2 Fs tsadd ■ EXAMPLE 7 Evaluate y 4 0 s2x 1 1 dx using (6). SOLUTION Using the substitution from Solution 1 of Example 2, we have u - 2x 1 1 and dx - 1 2 du. To ind the new limits of integration we note that when x - 0, u - 2s0d 1 1 - 1 and when x - 4, u - 2s4d 1 1 - 9 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

We simply evaluate the expression in u between the appropriate values of u. ■ EXAMPLE 8 Evaluate y 2 1 dx s3 2 5xd 2 . SOLUTION Let u - 3 2 5x. Then du - 25 dx, so dx - 2 1 5 du.

SOLUTION We let u - ln x because its differential du - dx yx occurs in the integral. When x - 1, u - ln 1 - 0; when x - e, u - ln e - 1. Thus y e 1 ln x x dx - y 1 0 u du - u 2 2 G 0 1 - 1 2 ■ Symmetry The next theorem uses the Substitution Rule for Deinite Integrals (6) to simplify the calculation of integrals of functions that possess symmetry properties. 7 Integrals of Symmetric Functions Suppose f is continuous on f2a, ag. (a) If f is even f f s2xd - f s xdg, then y a 2a f s xd dx - 2 y a 0 f s xd dx. (b) If f is odd f f s2xd - 2f s xdg, then y a 2a f s xd dx - 0.

","418 CHAPTER 5 Integrals In the irst integral on the far right side we make the substitution u - 2x. Then du - 2dx and when x - 2a, u - a. Therefore 2 y 2a 0 f s xd dx - 2 y a 0 f s2uds2dud - y a 0 f s2ud du and so Equation 8 becomes y a 2a f s xd dx - y a 0 f s2ud du 1 y a 0 f s xd dx (a) If f is even, then f s2ud - f sud so Equation 9 gives y a 2a f s xd dx - y a 0 f sud du 1 y a 0 f s xd dx - 2 y a 0 f s xd dx (b) If f is odd, then f s2ud - 2f sud and so Equation 9 gives y a 2a f s xd dx - 2 y a 0 f sud du 1 y a 0 f s xd dx - 0 ■ Theorem 7 is illustrated by Figure 3. For the case where f is positive and even, part (a) says that the area under y - f s xd from 2a to a is twice the area from 0 to a because of symmetry. Recall that an integral y b a f s xd dx can be expressed as the area above the x-axis and below y - f s xd minus the area below the axis and above the curve. Thus part (b) says the integral is 0 because the areas cancel.

What is the total basal metab- olism of this man, y 24 0 Rs t d dt, over a 24-hour time period? 81. An oil storage tank ruptures at time t - 0 and oil leaks from the tank at a rate of r s t d - 100e 20.01t liters per minute. How much oil leaks out during the first hour? 82. A bacteria population starts with 400 bacteria and grows at a rate of r std - s450.268de 1.12567t bacteria per hour. How many bacteria will there be after three hours? 83. Breathing is cyclic and a full respiratory cycle from the beginning of inhalation to the end of exhalation takes about 5 s. The maximum rate of air low into the lungs is about 0.5 Lys. This explains, in part, why the function f std - 1 2 sins2 t y5d has often been used to model the rate of air low into the lungs. Use this model to find the volume of inhaled air in the lungs at time t. 84. The rate of growth of a fish population was modeled by the equation Gstd - 60,000e 20.6t s1 1 5e 20.6 t d 2 where t is measured in years and G in kilograms per year. If the biomass was 25,000 kg in the year 2000, what is the predicted biomass for the year 2020? 85. Dialysis treatment removes urea and other waste products from a patient’s blood by diverting some of the bloodlow externally through a machine called a dialyzer. The rate at which urea is removed from the blood (in mgymin) is often well described by the equation ustd - r V C0 e 2rtyV where r is the rate of low of blood through the dialyzer (in mLymin), V is the volume of the patient’s blood (in mL), and C0 is the amount of urea in the blood (in mg) at time t - 0. Evaluate the integral y 30 0 us t d dt and interpret it. 86. Alabama Instruments Company has set up a production line to manufacture a new calculator. The rate of production of these calculators after t weeks is dx dt - 5000 S 1 2 100 st 1 10d 2 D calculatorsyweek (Notice that production approaches 5000 per week as time goes on, but the initial production is lower because of the workers’ unfamiliarity with the new techniques.) Find the number of calculators produced from the beginning of the third week to the end of the fourth week. 87. If f is continuous and y 4 0 f s xd dx - 10, find y 2 0 f s2xd dx. 88.

","425 Problems Plus Before you look at the solution of the following example, cover it up and irst try to solve the problem yourself. EXAMPLE Evaluate lim x l3 S x x 2 3 y x 3 sin t t dt D . SOLUTION Let’s start by having a preliminary look at the ingredients of the function. What happens to the irst factor, xys x 2 3d, when x approaches 3? The numerator approaches 3 and the denominator approaches 0, so we have x x 2 3 l ` as x l 3 1 and x x 2 3 l 2` as x l 3 2 The second factor approaches y 3 3 ssin tdyt dt, which is 0. It’ s not clear what happens to the function as a whole. (One factor is becoming large while the other is becoming small.) So how do we proceed? One of the principles of problem solving is recognizing something familiar. Is there a part of the function that reminds us of something we’ve seen before? Well, the integral y x 3 sin t t dt has x as its upper limit of integration and that type of integral occurs in Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: d dx y x a f std dt - f s xd This suggests that differentiation might be involved. Once we start thinking about differentiation, the denominator s x 2 3d reminds us of something else that should be familiar: One of the forms of the definition of the deriva- tive in Chapter 2 is F9 sad - lim x la Fs xd 2 Fsad x 2 a and with a - 3 this becomes F9 s3d - lim x l3 Fs xd 2 Fs3d x 2 3 So what is the function F in our situation? Notice that if we define Fs xd - y x 3 sin t t dt then Fs3d - 0. What about the factor x in the numerator? That’s just a red herring, so let’s factor it out and put together the calculation: lim x l3 S x x 2 3 y x 3 sin t t dt D - lim x l3 x ? lim x l3 y x 3 sin t t dt x 2 3 - 3 lim x l3 Fs xd 2 Fs3d x 2 3 - 3F9 s3d - 3 sin 3 3 - sin 3 (FTC1) ■ 1.
