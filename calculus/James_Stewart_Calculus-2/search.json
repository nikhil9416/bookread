","427 When a bat strikes a baseball, the collision lasts only about a thousandth of a second. In the project on page 464, you will use calculus to ind the average force on the bat when this happens. Several other applications of calculus to the game of baseball are explored as well. Applications of Integration 6 © Richard Paul Kane / Shutterstock.com IN THIS CHAPTER WE EXPLORE some of the applications of the deinite integral by using it to compute areas between curves, volumes of solids, and the work done by a varying force. The common theme is the following general method, which is similar to the one we used to ind areas under curves: we break up a quantity Q into a large number of small parts. We next approximate each small part by a quantity of the form f s x i *d Dx and thus approximate Q by a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit and express Q as an integral. Finally we evaluate the integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus or the Midpoint Rule. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","428 CHAPTER 6 Applications of Integration In Chapter 5 we deined and calculated areas of regions that lie under the graphs of func- tions. Here we use integrals to ind areas of regions that lie between the graphs of two functions. Consider the region S that lies between two curves y - f s xd and y - ts xd and between the vertical lines x - a and x - b, where f and t are continuous functions and f s xd > ts xd for all x in fa, bg. (See Figure 1.) Just as we did for areas under curves in Section 5.1, we divide S into n strips of equal width and then we approximate the ith strip by a rectangle with base Dx and height f s x i * d 2 ts x i * d. (See Figure 2. If we like, we could take all of the sample points to be right endpoints, in which case x i * - x i .) The Riemann sum o n i-1 f f s x i * d 2 ts x i * dg Dx is therefore an approximation to what we intuitively think of as the area of S. (a) Typical rectangle x y b 0 a f( x i *) f( x i *)-g( x i *) _g (x i *) x i * Îx (b) Approximating rectangles x y b 0 a This approximation appears to become better and better as n l `. Therefore we deine the area A of the region S as the limiting value of the sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles. A - lim n l ` o n i-1 f f s x i * d 2 ts x i * dg Dx We recognize the limit in (1) as the deinite integral of f 2 t. Therefore we have the following formula for area. 2 The area A of the region bounded by the curves y - f s xd , y - ts xd, and the lines x - a, x - b, where f and t are continuous and f s xd > ts xd for all x in fa, bg, is A - y b a f f s xd 2 ts xdg dx Notice that in the special case where ts xd - 0, S is the region under the graph of f and our general deinition of area (1) reduces to our previous deinition (Deinition 5.1.2).

","SECTION 6.1 Areas Between Curves 429 In the case where both f and t are positive, you can see from Figure 3 why (2) is true: A - farea under y - f s xdg 2 farea under y - ts xdg - y b a f s xd dx 2 y b a ts xd dx - y b a f f s xd 2 ts xdg dx EXAMPLE 1 Find the area of the region bounded above by y - e x , bounded below by y - x, and bounded on the sides by x - 0 and x - 1. SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 4. The upper boundary curve is y - e x and the lower boundary curve is y - x. So we use the area formula (2) with f s xd - e x , ts xd - x, a - 0, and b - 1: A - y 1 0 se x 2 xd dx - e x 2 1 2 x 2 g 1 0 - e 2 1 2 2 1 - e 2 1.5 ■ In Figure 4 we drew a typical approximating rectangle with width Dx as a reminder of the procedure by which the area is deined in (1). In general, when we set up an integral for an area, it’s helpful to sketch the region to identify the top curve y T , the bottom curve y B , and a typical approximating rectangle as in Figure 5. Then the area of a typical rect- angle is s y T 2 y B d Dx and the equation A - lim n l ` o n i-1 s y T 2 y B d Dx - y b a s y T 2 y B d dx summarizes the procedure of adding (in a limiting sense) the areas of all the typical rectangles. Notice that in Figure 5 the left-hand boundary reduces to a point, whereas in Figure 3 the right-hand boundary reduces to a point. In the next example both of the side boundar- ies reduce to a point, so the irst step is to ind a and b. EXAMPLE 2 Find the area of the region enclosed by the parabolas y - x 2 and y - 2x 2 x 2 . SOLUTION We irst ind the points of intersection of the parabolas by solving their equations simultaneously. This gives x 2 - 2x 2 x 2 , or 2x 2 2 2x - 0. Thus 2x s x 2 1d - 0, so x - 0 or 1. The points of intersection are s0, 0d and s1, 1d. We see from Figure 6 that the top and bottom boundaries are y T - 2x 2 x 2 and y B - x 2 The area of a typical rectangle is s y T 2 y B d Dx - s2x 2 x 2 2 x 2 d Dx and the region lies between x - 0 and x - 1. So the total area is A - y 1 0 s2x 2 2x 2 d dx - 2 y 1 0 s x 2 x 2 d dx - 2 F x 2 2 2 x 3 3 G 0 1 - 2 S 1 2 2 1 3 D - 1 3 ■ 0 x y a b y T y B y T -y B Îx 0 x y a b y=ƒ y=© S 0 x y 1 y=´ y=x Îx x=1 1 FIGURE 3 A - y b a f s xd dx 2 y b a ts xd dx FIGURE 4 FIGURE 5 FIGURE 6 Îx (0, 0) (1, 1) y T =2x-≈ y B =≈ x y Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","430 CHAPTER 6 Applications of Integration Sometimes it’s dificult, or even impossible, to ind the points of intersection of two curves exactly. As shown in the following example, we can use a graphing calculator or computer to ind approximate values for the intersection points and then proceed as before. EXAMPLE 3 Find the approximate area of the region bounded by the curves y - x y sx 2 1 1 and y - x 4 2 x. SOLUTION If we were to try to ind the exact intersection points, we would have to solve the equation x sx 2 1 1 - x 4 2 x This looks like a very dificult equation to solve exactly (in fact, it’s impossible), so instead we use a graphing device to draw the graphs of the two curves in Figure 7. One intersection point is the origin. We zoom in toward the other point of intersection and ind that x < 1.18. (If greater accuracy is required, we could use Newton’s method or solve numerically on our graphing device.) So an approximation to the area between the curves is A < y 1.18 0 F x sx 2 1 1 2 s x 4 2 xd G dx To integrate the irst term we use the substitution u - x 2 1 1. Then du - 2xdx, and when x - 1.18, we have u < 2.39; when x - 0, u - 1. So A < 1 2 y 2.39 1 du su 2 y 1.18 0 s x 4 2 xd dx - su g 1 2.39 2 F x 5 5 2 x 2 2 G 0 1.18 - s2.39 2 1 2 s1.18d 5 5 1 s1.18d 2 2 < 0.785 ■ EXAMPLE 4 Figure 8 shows velocity curves for two cars, A and B, that start side by side and move along the same road. What does the area between the curves represent? Use the Midpoint Rule to estimate it. SOLUTION We know from Section 5.4 that the area under the velocity curve A rep- resents the distance traveled by car A during the irst 16 seconds. Similarly, the area under curve B is the distance traveled by car B during that time period. So the area between these curves, which is the difference of the areas under the curves, is the distance between the cars after 16 seconds.

It shows how the disease develops in an individual with no immunity after the measles virus spreads to the bloodstream from the respiratory tract. 0 N t Infectiousness begins Symptoms appear Infectiousness ends Pathogen is cleared Pathogen enters plasma (days) 10–11 12 21 17–18 1000 1500 500 Number of infected cells per mL of blood plasma The patient becomes infectious to others once the concentration of infected cells becomes great enough, and he or she remains infectious until the immune system manages to prevent further transmission. However, symptoms don’t develop until the “amount of infection” reaches a particular threshold. The amount of infection needed to develop symptoms depends on both the concentration of infected cells and time, and corresponds to the area under the pathogenesis curve until symptoms appear. (See Exercise 5.1.19.) (a) The pathogenesis curve in Figure 9 has been modeled by f std - 2t st 2 21dst 1 1d. If infectiousness begins on day t 1 - 10 and ends on day t 2 - 18, what are the corre- sponding concentration levels of infected cells? (b) The level of infectiousness for an infected person is the area between N - f std and the line through the points P 1 st 1 , f st 1 dd and P 2 st 2 , f st 2 dd, measured in (cellsymL) ? days. (See Figure 10.) Compute the level of infectiousness for this particular patient. SOLUTION (a) Infectiousness begins when the concentration reaches f s10d - 1210 cellsymL and ends when the concentration reduces to f s18d - 1026 cellsymL.

","436 CHAPTER 6 Applications of Integration How is it possible to measure the distribution of income among the inhabitants of a given country? One such measure is the Gini index, named after the Italian economist Corrado Gini, who irst devised it in 1912. We irst rank all households in a country by income and then we compute the percentage of households whose income is at most a given percentage of the country’s total income. We deine a Lorenz curve y - Ls xd on the interval f0, 1g by plotting the point say100, by100d on the curve if the bottom a% of households receive at most b% of the total income. For instance, in Figure 1 (on page 437) the point s0.4, 0.12d is on the Lorenz curve for the United States in 2010 because the poorest 40% of the population received just 12% of the total income. Likewise, the bottom 80% of the population received 50% of the total income, so the point s0.8, 0.5d lies on the Lorenz curve. (The Lorenz curve is named after the American economist Max Lorenz.) (b) Let P3 be the point on the graph of t where infectious- ness begins.

","APPLIED PROJECT The Gini Index 437 Figure 2 shows some typical Lorenz curves. They all pass through the points s0, 0d and s1, 1d and are concave upward. In the extreme case Ls xd - x, society is perfectly egalitarian: the poorest a% of the population receives a% of the total income and so everybody receives the same income. The area between a Lorenz curve y - Ls xd and the line y - x measures how much the income distribution differs from absolute equality.

","438 CHAPTER 6 Applications of Integration In trying to ind the volume of a solid we face the same type of problem as in inding areas. We have an intuitive idea of what volume means, but we must make this idea pre- cise by using calculus to give an exact deinition of volume. We start with a simple type of solid called a cylinder (or, more precisely, a right cyl- inder). As illustrated in Figure 1(a), a cylinder is bounded by a plane region B 1 , called the base, and a congruent region B 2 in a parallel plane. The cylinder consists of all points on line segments that are perpendicular to the base and join B 1 to B 2 . If the area of the base is A and the height of the cylinder (the distance from B 1 to B 2 ) is h, then the volume V of the cylinder is deined as V - Ah In particular, if the base is a circle with radius r, then the cylinder is a circular cylinder with volume V - r 2 h [see Figure 1(b)], and if the base is a rectangle with length l and width w, then the cylinder is a rectangular box (also called a rectangular parallelepiped ) with volume V - lwh [see Figure 1(c)]. (a) Cylinder V=Ah h B¡ B™ (b) Circular cylinder V=πr@h h r (c) Rectangular box V=lwh h l w For a solid S that isn’t a cylinder we irst “cut” S into pieces and approximate each piece by a cylinder. We estimate the volume of S by adding the volumes of the cylinders. We arrive at the exact volume of S through a limiting process in which the number of pieces becomes large. We start by intersecting S with a plane and obtaining a plane region that is called a cross-section of S. Let As xd be the area of the cross-section of S in a plane P x perpendic- ular to the x-axis and passing through the point x, where a < x < b. (See Figure 2. Think of slicing S with a knife through x and computing the area of this slice.) The cross- sectional area As xd will vary as x increases from a to b. y x 0 a b x S A(a) A(b) A(x) P x FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 6.2 Volumes 439 Let’s divide S into n “slabs” of equal width Dx by using the planes P x1 , P x 2 , . . . to slice the solid. (Think of slicing a loaf of bread.) If we choose sample points x i * in fx i21 , x i g, we can approximate the ith slab S i (the part of S that lies between the planes P x i21 and P x i ) by a cylinder with base area Asx i *d and “height” Dx. (See Figure 3.) x i-1 x i y 0 x x* i Îx S a b y 0 x x¶=b a=x¸ / x™ ‹ x¢ x∞ xß The volume of this cylinder is As x i * d Dx, so an approximation to our intuitive concep- tion of the volume of the ith slab S i is VsS i d< As x i * d Dx Adding the volumes of these slabs, we get an approximation to the total volume (that is, what we think of intuitively as the volume): V < o n i-1 As x i * d Dx This approximation appears to become better and better as n l `. (Think of the slices as becoming thinner and thinner.) Therefore we deine the volume as the limit of these sums as n l `. But we recognize the limit of Riemann sums as a deinite integral and so we have the following deinition. Deinition of Volume Let S be a solid that lies between x - a and x - b. If the cross-sectional area of S in the plane P x , through x and perpendicular to the x-axis, is As xd, where A is a continuous function, then the volume of S is V - lim n l` o n i-1 As x i * d Dx - y b a As xd dx When we use the volume formula V - y b a As xd dx, it is important to remember that As xd is the area of a moving cross-section obtained by slicing through x perpendicular to the x-axis. Notice that, for a cylinder, the cross-sectional area is constant: As xd - A for all x. So our deinition of volume gives V - y b a A dx - Asb 2 ad; this agrees with the formula V - Ah. EXAMPLE 1 Show that the volume of a sphere of radius r is V - 4 3 r 3 . SOLUTION If we place the sphere so that its center is at the origin, then the plane P x intersects the sphere in a circle whose radius (from the Pythagorean Theorem) is FIGURE 3 It can be proved that this deinition is independent of how S is situated with respect to the x-axis. In other words, no matter how we slice S with parallel planes, we always get the same answer for V. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 7(a) and the resulting solid is shown in Fig- ure 7(b). Because the region is rotated about the y-axis, it makes sense to slice the solid perpendicular to the y-axis (obtaining circular cross-sections) and therefore to integrate with respect to y. If we slice at height y, we get a circular disk with radius x, where x - s 3 y . So the area of a cross-section through y is As yd -  x 2 -  (s 3 y ) 2 -  y 2y3 and the volume of the approximating cylinder pictured in Figure 7(b) is As yd Dy -  y 2y3 Dy Since the solid lies between y - 0 and y - 8, its volume is V - y 8 0 As yd dy - y 8 0  y 2y3 dy -  f 3 5 y 5y3 g 0 8 - 96 5 y=8 x=0 y=˛ or (a) 0 y (x, y) Îy (b) x y 0 x y 8 x=oe„ y 3 x x=oe„ y 3 ■ Did we get a reasonable answer in Example 2?

Any plane P x that passes through x and is perpendicular to the x-axis intersects the pyramid in a square with side of length s, say. We can express s in terms of x by observing from the similar triangles in Figure 15 that x h - sy2 Ly2 - s L and so s - Lxyh.

Some of the pioneers of calculus, such as Kepler and Newton, were inspired by the problem of inding the volumes of wine barrels. (In fact Kepler published a book Stereometria doliorum in 1615 devoted to methods for inding the volumes of barrels.) They often approximated the shape of the sides by parabolas. (a) A barrel with height h and maximum radius R is con- structed by rotating about the x-axis the parabola y - R 2 cx 2 , 2hy2 < x < hy2, where c is a positive constant. Show that the radius of each end of the barrel is r - R 2 d, where d - ch 2 y4. (b) Show that the volume enclosed by the barrel is V - 1 3 hs2R 2 1 r 2 2 2 5 d 2 d 72. Suppose that a region 5 has area A and lies above the x-axis. When 5 is rotated about the x-axis, it sweeps out a solid with volume V1. When 5 is rotated about the line y - 2k (where k is a positive number), it sweeps out a solid with volume V2 . Express V2 in terms of V1, k, and A. Some volume problems are very dificult to handle by the methods of the preceding section. For instance, let’s consider the problem of inding the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the y -axis the region bounded by y - 2x 2 2 x 3 and y - 0. (See Figure 1.) If we slice perpendicular to the y -axis, we get a washer. But to compute the inner radius and the outer radius of the washer, we’d have to solve the cubic equation y - 2x 2 2 x 3 for x in terms of y ; that’s not easy. Fortunately, there is a method, called the method of cylindrical shells, that is easier to use in such a case.

","452 CHAPTER 6 Applications of Integration y x NOTE Comparing the solution of Example 1 with the remarks at the beginning of this section, we see that the method of cylindrical shells is much easier than the washer method for this problem. We did not have to ind the coordinates of the local maximum and we did not have to solve the equation of the curve for x in terms of y. However, in other examples the methods of the preceding section may be easier. EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the y-axis the region between y - x and y - x 2 .

EXAMPLE 3 Use cylindrical shells to ind the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the x-axis the region under the curve y - sx from 0 to 1. SOLUTION This problem was solved using disks in Example 6.2.2. To use shells we relabel the curve y - sx (in the igure in that example) as x - y 2 in Figure 9.

There are several considerations to take into account: Is the region more easily described by top and bottom boundary curves of the form y - f s xd, or by left and right boundaries x - ts yd? Which choice is easier to work with? Are the limits of integration easier to ind for one variable versus the other? Does the region require two separate integrals when using x as the variable but only one inte- gral in y ? Are we able to evaluate the integral we set up with our choice of variable? If we decide that one variable is easier to work with than the other, then this dictates which method to use. Draw a sample rectangle in the region, corresponding to a cross- section of the solid. The thickness of the rectangle, either Dx or Dy, corresponds to the integration variable. If you imagine the rectangle revolving, it becomes either a disk (washer) or a shell. FIGURE 10 1.

A sphere of radius r The term work is used in everyday language to mean the total amount of effort required to perform a task. In physics it has a technical meaning that depends on the idea of a force. Intuitively, you can think of a force as describing a push or pull on an object—for example, a horizontal push of a book across a table or the downward pull of the earth’s gravity on a ball. In general, if an object moves along a straight line with position func- tion sstd, then the force F on the object (in the same direction) is given by Newton’s Second Law of Motion as the product of its mass m and its acceleration a: F - ma - m d 2 s dt 2 In the SI metric system, the mass is measured in kilograms (kg), the displacement in meters (m), the time in seconds (s), and the force in newtons (N - kg∙mys 2 ). Thus a force of 1 N acting on a mass of 1 kg produces an acceleration of 1 mys 2 . In the US Customary system the fundamental unit is chosen to be the unit of force, which is the pound. In the case of constant acceleration, the force F is also constant and the work done is deined to be the product of the force F and the distance d that the object moves: W - Fd work - force 3 distance If F is measured in newtons and d in meters, then the unit for W is a newton-meter, which is called a joule (J). If F is measured in pounds and d in feet, then the unit for W is a foot-pound (ft-lb), which is about 1.36 J. 1 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","456 CHAPTER 6 Applications of Integration EXAMPLE 1 (a) How much work is done in lifting a 1.2-kg book off the loor to put it on a desk that is 0.7 m high? Use the fact that the acceleration due to gravity is t - 9.8 mys 2 . (b) How much work is done in lifting a 20-lb weight 6 ft off the ground? SOLUTION (a) The force exerted is equal and opposite to that exerted by gravity, so Equation 1 gives F - mt - s1.2ds9.8d - 11.76 N and then Equation 2 gives the work done as W - Fd - s11.76 Nds0.7 md< 8.2 J (b) Here the force is given as F - 20 lb, so the work done is W - Fd - s20 lbds6 ftd - 120 ft-lb Notice that in part (b), unlike part (a), we did not have to multiply by t because we were given the weight (which is a force) and not the mass of the object. ■ Equation 2 deines work as long as the force is constant, but what happens if the force is variable? Let’s suppose that the object moves along the x-axis in the positive direction, from x - a to x - b, and at each point x between a and b a force f s xd acts on the object, where f is a continuous function. We divide the interval fa, bg into n subintervals with endpoints x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x n and equal width Dx. We choose a sample point x i * in the ith subinterval fx i21 , x i g. Then the force at that point is f s x i * d. If n is large, then Dx is small, and since f is continuous, the values of f don’t change very much over the interval fx i21 , x i g. In other words, f is almost constant on the interval and so the work W i that is done in moving the particle from x i21 to x i is approximately given by Equation 2: W i < f sx i * d Dx Thus we can approximate the total work by W < o n i-1 f s x i * d Dx It seems that this approximation becomes better as we make n larger. Therefore we deine the work done in moving the object from a to b as the limit of this quantity as n l `. Since the right side of (3) is a Riemann sum, we recognize its limit as being a deinite integral and so W - lim n l` o n i-1 f s x i * d Dx - y b a f s xd dx EXAMPLE 2 When a particle is located a distance x feet from the origin, a force of x 2 1 2x pounds acts on it.

Hooke’s Law states that the force required to maintain a spring stretched x units beyond its natural length is proportional to x: f s xd - kx where k is a positive constant called the spring constant (see Figure 1). Hooke’s Law holds provided that x is not too large. EXAMPLE 3 A force of 40 N is required to hold a spring that has been stretched from its natural length of 10 cm to a length of 15 cm. How much work is done in stretching the spring from 15 cm to 18 cm? SOLUTION According to Hooke’s Law, the force required to hold the spring stretched x meters beyond its natural length is f s xd - kx. When the spring is stretched from 10 cm to 15 cm, the amount stretched is 5 cm - 0.05 m. This means that f s0.05d - 40, so 0.05k - 40 k - 40 0.05 - 800 Thus f s xd - 800x and the work done in stretching the spring from 15 cm to 18 cm is W - y 0.08 0.05 800xdx - 800 x 2 2 G 0.05 0.08 - 400fs0.08d 2 2 s0.05d 2 g - 1.56 J ■ EXAMPLE 4 A 200-lb cable is 100 ft long and hangs vertically from the top of a tall building. How much work is required to lift the cable to the top of the building? SOLUTION Here we don’t have a formula for the force function, but we can use an argument similar to the one that led to Deinition 4. Let’s place the origin at the top of the building and the x-axis pointing downward as in Figure 2. We divide the cable into small parts with length Dx. If x i * is a point in the ith such interval, then all points in the interval are lifted by approximately the same amount, namely x i *. The cable weighs 2 pounds per foot, so the weight of the ith part is (2 lbyft)(Dx ft) - 2 Dx lb. Thus the work done on the ith part, in foot-pounds, is s2 Dxd ? x i * - 2x i * Dx force distance We get the total work done by adding all these approximations and letting the num- ber of parts become large (so Dx l 0): W - lim n l ` o n i-1 2 x i * Dx - y 100 0 2x dx - x 2 g 100 0 - 10,000 ft-lb ■ EXAMPLE 5 A tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone with height 10 m and base radius 4 m.

","458 CHAPTER 6 Applications of Integration SOLUTION Let’s measure depths from the top of the tank by introducing a vertical coordinate line as in Figure 3. The water extends from a depth of 2 m to a depth of 10 m and so we divide the interval f2, 10g into n subintervals with endpoints x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x n and choose x i * in the ith subinterval. This divides the water into n layers. The ith layer is approximated by a circular cylinder with radius r i and height Dx. We can compute r i from similar triangles, using Figure 4, as follows: r i 10 2 x i * - 4 10 r i - 2 5 s10 2 x i * d Thus an approximation to the volume of the ith layer of water is V i < r i 2 Dx - 4 25 s10 2 x i * d 2 Dx and so its mass is m i - density 3 volume < 1000 ? 4 25 s10 2 x i * d 2 Dx - 160s10 2 x i * d 2 Dx The force required to raise this layer must overcome the force of gravity and so F i - m i t <s9.8d160s10 2 x i * d 2 Dx - 1568 s10 2 x i * d 2 Dx Each particle in the layer must travel a distance upward of approximately x i * .

When gas expands in a cylinder with radius r, the pressure at any given time is a function of the volume: P - PsV d. The force exerted by the gas on the piston (see the figure) is the product of the pressure and the area: F - r 2 P. Show that the work done by the gas when the volume expands from volume V1 to volume V2 is W - y V 2 V 1 P dV x V piston head 30. In a steam engine the pressure P and volume V of steam satisfy the equation PV 1.4 - k, where k is a constant. (This is true for adiabatic expansion, that is, expansion in which there is no heat transfer between the cylinder and its sur- roundings.) Use Exercise 29 to calculate the work done by the engine during a cycle when the steam starts at a pressure of 160 lbyin 2 and a volume of 100 in 3 and expands to a vol- ume of 800 in 3 . 31. The kinetic energy KE of an object of mass m moving with velocity v is defined as KE - 1 2 mv 2 . If a force f s xd acts on the object, moving it along the x-axis from x1 to x 2, the Work-Energy Theorem states that the net work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy: 1 2 mv 2 2 2 1 2 mv 2 1 , where v 1 is the velocity at x1 and v2 is the velocity at x 2. (a) Let x - sstd be the position function of the object at time t and v std, astd the velocity and acceleration func- tions. Prove the Work-Energy Theorem by first using the Substitution Rule for Definite Integrals (5.5.6) to show that W - y x 2 x1 f sxd dx - y t 2 t1 f ssstdd v std dt ; Then use Newton’s Second Law of Motion (force - mass 3 acceleration) and the substitution u - v std to evaluate the integral.

","SECTION 6.5 Average Value of a Function 461 It is easy to calculate the average value of initely many numbers y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y n : y ave - y 1 1 y 2 1 ∙∙∙ 1 y n n But how do we compute the average temperature during a day if ininitely many tem- perature readings are possible? Figure 1 shows the graph of a temperature function Tstd, where t is measured in hours and T in °C, and a guess at the average temperature, T ave . In general, let’s try to compute the average value of a function y - f s xd, a < x < b. We start by dividing the interval fa, bg into n equal subintervals, each with length Dx - sb 2 adyn. Then we choose points x 1 * , . . . , x n * in successive subintervals and cal- culate the average of the numbers f sx 1 * d, . . . , f sx n * d: f sx 1 * d 1 ∙∙∙ 1 f sx n * d n (For example, if f represents a temperature function and n - 24, this means that we take temperature readings every hour and then average them.) Since Dx - sb 2 adyn, we can write n - sb 2 adyDx and the average value becomes f s x 1 * d 1 ∙∙∙ 1 f s x n * d b 2 a Dx - 1 b 2 a f f s x 1 * d 1 ∙∙∙ 1 f s x n * dg Dx - 1 b 2 a f f s x 1 * d Dx 1 ∙∙∙ 1 f s x n * d Dxg - 1 b 2 a o n i-1 f s x i * d Dx If we let n increase, we would be computing the average value of a large number of closely spaced values. (For example, we would be averaging temperature readings taken every minute or even every second.) The limiting value is lim n l` 1 b 2 a o n i-1 f s x i * d Dx - 1 b 2 a y b a f s xd dx by the deinition of a deinite integral. Therefore we deine the average value of f on the interval fa, bg as f ave - 1 b 2 a y b a f s xd dx EXAMPLE 1 Find the average value of the function f s xd - 1 1 x 2 on the interval f21, 2g.

","462 CHAPTER 6 Applications of Integration graphed in Figure 1, we see that there are two such times––just before noon and just before midnight. In general, is there a number c at which the value of a function f is exactly equal to the average value of the function, that is, f scd - f ave ? The following theorem says that this is true for continuous functions. The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals If f is continuous on fa, bg , then there exists a number c in fa, bg such that f scd - f ave - 1 b 2 a y b a f s xd dx that is, y b a f s xd dx - f scdsb 2 ad The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is a consequence of the Mean Value Theorem for derivatives and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The proof is outlined in Exer- cise 25. The geometric interpretation of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is that, for positive functions f , there is a number c such that the rectangle with base fa, bg and height f scd has the same area as the region under the graph of f from a to b. (See Figure 2 and the more picturesque interpretation in the margin note.) EXAMPLE 2 Since f s xd - 1 1 x 2 is continuous on the interval f21, 2g, the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals says there is a number c in f21, 2g such that y 2 21 s1 1 x 2 d dx - f scdf2 2 s21dg In this particular case we can ind c explicitly. From Example 1 we know that f ave - 2, so the value of c satisies f scd - f ave - 2 Therefore 1 1 c 2 - 2 so c 2 - 1 So in this case there happen to be two numbers c - 61 in the interval f21, 2g that work in the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals. ■ Examples 1 and 2 are illustrated by Figure 3.

","464 CHAPTER 6 Applications of Integration APPLIED PROJECT CALCULUS AND BASEBALL In this project we explore three of the many applications of calculus to baseball. The physical inter- actions of the game, especially the collision of ball and bat, are quite complex and their models are discussed in detail in a book by Robert Adair, The Physics of Baseball, 3d ed. (New York, 2002). 1. It may surprise you to learn that the collision of baseball and bat lasts only about a thou- sandth of a second. Here we calculate the average force on the bat during this collision by irst computing the change in the ball’s momentum. The momentum p of an object is the product of its mass m and its velocity v, that is, p - mv. Suppose an object, moving along a straight line, is acted on by a force F - Fst d that is a continuous function of time. (a) Show that the change in momentum over a time interval ft0, t1g is equal to the integral of F from t0 to t1; that is, show that pst1d 2 pst 0 d - y t 1 t 0 Fs t d dt This integral is called the impulse of the force over the time interval. (b) A pitcher throws a 90-miyh fastball to a batter, who hits a line drive directly back to the pitcher. The ball is in contact with the bat for 0.001 s and leaves the bat with velocity 110 miyh. A baseball weighs 5 oz and, in US Customary units, its mass is measured in slugs: m - wy t, where t - 32 ftys 2 . (i) Find the change in the ball’s momentum. (ii) Find the average force on the bat. 2. In this problem we calculate the work required for a pitcher to throw a 90-miyh fastball by irst considering kinetic energy. The kinetic energy K of an object of mass m and velocity v is given by K - 1 2 mv 2 . Suppose an object of mass m, moving in a straight line, is acted on by a force F - Fs s d that depends on its position s. According to Newton’s Second Law Fssd - ma - m dv dt where a and v denote the acceleration and velocity of the object. (a) Show that the work done in moving the object from a position s0 to a position s1 is equal to the change in the object’s kinetic energy; that is, show that W - y s 1 s 0 Fs s d ds - 1 2 mv1 2 2 1 2 mv 0 2 24.

(a) An outielder ields a baseball 280 ft away from home plate and throws it directly to the catcher with an initial velocity of 100 ftys. Assume that the velocity vstd of the ball after t seconds satisfies the differential equation dvy dt - 2 1 10 v because of air resistance. How long does it take for the ball to reach home plate? (Ignore any verti- cal motion of the ball.) (b) The manager of the team wonders whether the ball will reach home plate sooner if it is relayed by an infielder. The shortstop can position himself directly between the out- fielder and home plate, catch the ball thrown by the outfielder, turn, and throw the ball to the catcher with an initial velocity of 105 ftys. The manager clocks the relay time of the shortstop (catching, turning, throwing) at half a second. How far from home plate should the shortstop position himself to minimize the total time for the ball to reach home plate? Should the manager encourage a direct throw or a relayed throw? What if the shortstop can throw at 115 ftys? (c) For what throwing velocity of the shortstop does a relayed throw take the same time as a direct throw? ; A movie theater has a screen that is positioned 10 ft off the loor and is 25 ft high. The irst row of seats is placed 9 ft from the screen and the rows are set 3 ft apart. The loor of the seating area is inclined at an angle of  - 20° above the horizontal and the distance up the incline that you sit is x. The theater has 21 rows of seats, so 0 < x < 60. Suppose you decide that the best place to sit is in the row where the angle  subtended by the screen at your eyes is a maximum. Let’s also suppose that your eyes are 4 ft above the loor, as shown in the igure.

A cylindrical container of radius r and height L is partially illed with a liquid whose volume is V.

Even- tually, the liquid will be rotating at the same angular speed as the container. The surface of the liquid will be convex, as indicated in the igure, because the centrifugal force on the liquid particles increases with the distance from the axis of the container.

Techniques of Integration BECAUSE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM of Calculus, we can integrate a function if we know an antiderivative, that is, an indeinite integral. We summarize here the most important integrals that we have learned so far. y x n dx - x n11 n 1 1 1 C sn ± 21d y 1 x dx - ln | x | 1 C y e x dx - e x 1 C y b x dx - b x ln b 1 C y sin x dx - 2cos x 1 C y cos x dx - sin x 1 C y sec 2 x dx - tan x 1 C y csc 2 x dx - 2cot x 1 C y sec x tan x dx - sec x 1 C y csc x cot x dx - 2csc x 1 C y sinh x dx - cosh x 1 C y cosh x dx - sinh x 1 C y tan x dx - ln | sec x | 1 C y cot x dx - ln | sin x | 1 C y 1 x 2 1 a 2 dx - 1 a tan 21 S x a D 1 C y 1 sa 2 2 x 2 dx - sin 21 S x a D 1 C, a . 0 In this chapter we develop techniques for using these basic integration formulas to obtain indeinite integrals of more complicated functions. We learned the most important method of inte- gration, the Substitution Rule, in Section 5.5. The other general technique, integration by parts, is presented in Section 7.1. Then we learn methods that are special to particular classes of functions, such as trigonometric functions and rational functions. Integration is not as straightforward as differentiation; there are no rules that absolutely guar- antee obtaining an indeinite integral of a function. Therefore we discuss a strategy for integration in Section 7.5. 7 USDA Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

","472 CHAPTER 7 Techniques of Integration Every differentiation rule has a corresponding integration rule. For instance, the Substi- tution Rule for integration corresponds to the Chain Rule for differentiation. The rule that corresponds to the Product Rule for differentiation is called the rule for integration by parts. The Product Rule states that if f and t are differentiable functions, then d dx f f s xd ts xdg - f s xd t9 s xd 1 ts xd f 9 s xd In the notation for indeinite integrals this equation becomes y f f s xd t9 s xd 1 ts xd f 9 s xdg dx - f s xd ts xd or y f s xd t9 s xd dx 1 y ts xd f 9 s xd dx - f s xd ts xd We can rearrange this equation as y f s xd t9 s xd dx - f s xd ts xd 2 y ts xd f 9 s xd dx Formula 1 is called the formula for integration by parts. It is perhaps easier to remem- ber in the following notation. Let u - f s xd and v - ts xd. Then the differentials are du - f 9 s xd dx and dv - t9 s xd dx, so, by the Substitution Rule, the formula for integra- tion by parts becomes y udv - uv 2 y v du EXAMPLE 1 Find y x sin x dx. SOLUTION USING FORMULA 1 Suppose we choose f s xd - x and t9 s xd - sin x. Then f 9 s xd - 1 and ts xd - 2cos x. (For t we can choose any antiderivative of t9.) Thus, using Formula 1, we have y x sin x dx - f s xd ts xd 2 y ts xd f 9 s xd dx - x s2cos xd 2 y s2cos xd dx - 2x cos x 1 y cos x dx - 2x cos x 1 sin x 1 C 1 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Thus in Example 1 we started with y x sin x dx and expressed it in terms of the simpler integral y cos x dx. If we had instead chosen u - sin x and dv - x dx, then du - cos x dx and v - x 2 y2, so integration by parts gives y x sin x dx - ssin xd x 2 2 2 1 2 y x 2 cos x dx Although this is true, y x 2 cos x dx is a more difficult integral than the one we started with. In general, when deciding on a choice for u and dv, we usually try to choose u - f s xd to be a function that becomes simpler when differentiated (or at least not more complicated) as long as dv - t9 s xd dx can be readily integrated to give v. EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate y ln x dx. SOLUTION Here we don’t have much choice for u and dv. Let u - ln x dv - dx Then du - 1 x dx v - x Integrating by parts, we get y ln x dx - x ln x 2 y x dx x - x ln x 2 y dx - x ln x 2 x 1 C Integration by parts is effective in this example because the derivative of the func- tion f s xd - ln x is simpler than f . ■ It is helpful to use the pattern: u -  dv -  du -  v -  It’s customary to write y 1 dx as y dx.

Therefore we use integration by parts a second time, this time with u - t and dv - e t dt. Then du - dt, v - e t , and y te t dt - te t 2 y e t dt - te t 2 e t 1 C Putting this in Equation 3, we get y t 2 e t dt - t 2 e t 2 2 y te t dt - t 2 e t 2 2ste t 2 e t 1 C d - t 2 e t 2 2te t 1 2e t 1 C 1 where C 1 - 22C ■ EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate y e x sin x dx. SOLUTION Neither e x nor sin x becomes simpler when differentiated, but we try choos- ing u - e x and dv - sin x dx anyway. Then du - e x dx and v - 2cos x, so integration by parts gives y e x sin x dx - 2e x cos x 1 y e x cos x dx The integral that we have obtained, y e x cos x dx, is no simpler than the original one, but at least it’s no more dificult. Having had success in the preceding example integrating by parts twice, we persevere and integrate by parts again. This time we use u - e x and dv - cos x dx. Then du - e x dx, v - sin x, and y e x cos x dx - e x sin x 2 y e x sin x dx At irst glance, it appears as if we have accomplished nothing because we have arrived at y e x sin x dx, which is where we started.

A rocket accelerates by burning its onboard fuel, so its mass decreases with time. Suppose the initial mass of the rocket at liftoff (including its fuel) is m, the fuel is consumed at rate r, and the exhaust gases are ejected with constant velocity ve (relative to the rocket). A model for the velocity of the rocket at time t is given by the equation vstd - 2t t 2 ve ln m 2 rt m where t is the acceleration due to gravity and t is not too large. If t - 9.8 my s 2 , m - 30,000 kg, r - 160 kgy s, and ve - 3000 my s, ind the height of the rocket one minute after liftoff. 69. A particle that moves along a straight line has velocity vstd - t 2 e 2t meters per second after t seconds. How far will it travel during the irst t seconds? 70.

","SECTION 7.2 Trigonometric Integrals 479 In this section we use trigonometric identities to integrate certain combinations of trigo- nometric functions. We start with powers of sine and cosine. EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate y cos 3 x dx. SOLUTION Simply substituting u - cos x isn’t helpful, since then du - 2sin x dx. In order to integrate powers of cosine, we would need an extra sin x factor. Similarly, a power of sine would require an extra cos x factor. Thus here we can separate one cosine factor and convert the remaining cos 2 x factor to an expression involving sine using the identity sin 2 x 1 cos 2 x - 1: cos 3 x - cos 2 x ? cos x - s1 2 sin 2 xd cos x We can then evaluate the integral by substituting u - sin x, so du - cos x dx and y cos 3 x dx - y cos 2 x ? cos x dx - y s1 2 sin 2 xd cos x dx - y s1 2 u 2 d du - u 2 1 3 u 3 1 C - sin x 2 1 3 sin 3 x 1 C ■ In general, we try to write an integrand involving powers of sine and cosine in a form where we have only one sine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms of cosine) or only one cosine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms of sine). The identity sin 2 x 1 cos 2 x - 1 enables us to convert back and forth between even pow- ers of sine and cosine. EXAMPLE 2 Find y sin 5 x cos 2 x dx. SOLUTION We could convert cos 2 x to 1 2 sin 2 x, but we would be left with an expres- sion in terms of sin x with no extra cos x factor. Instead, we separate a single sine factor and rewrite the remaining sin 4 x factor in terms of cos x: sin 5 x cos 2 x - ssin 2 xd 2 cos 2 x sin x - s1 2 cos 2 xd 2 cos 2 x sin x Substituting u - cos x, we have du - 2sin x dx and so y sin 5 x cos 2 x dx - y ssin 2 xd 2 cos 2 x sin x dx - y s1 2 cos 2 xd 2 cos 2 x sin x dx - y s1 2 u 2 d 2 u 2 s2dud - 2 y su 2 2 2u 4 1 u 6 d du - 2 S u 3 3 2 2 u 5 5 1 u 7 7 D 1 C - 2 1 3 cos 3 x 1 2 5 cos 5 x 2 1 7 cos 7 x 1 C ■ Figure 1 shows the graphs of the integrand sin 5 x cos 2 x in Example 2 and its indeinite integral (with C - 0).

","480 CHAPTER 7 Techniques of Integration In the preceding examples, an odd power of sine or cosine enabled us to separate a single factor and convert the remaining even power. If the integrand contains even pow- ers of both sine and cosine, this strategy fails. In this case, we can take advantage of the following half-angle identities (see Equations 17b and 17a in Appendix D): sin 2 x - 1 2 s1 2 cos 2xd and cos 2 x - 1 2 s1 1 cos 2xd EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate y  0 sin 2 x dx. SOLUTION If we write sin 2 x - 1 2 cos 2 x, the integral is no simpler to evaluate. Using the half-angle formula for sin 2 x, however, we have y  0 sin 2 x dx - 1 2 y  0 s1 2 cos 2xd dx - f 1 2 ( x 2 1 2 sin 2x)g 0  - 1 2 s 2 1 2 sin 2d 2 1 2 s0 2 1 2 sin 0d - 1 2  Notice that we mentally made the substitution u - 2x when integrating cos 2x. Another method for evaluating this integral was given in Exercise 7.1.47. ■ EXAMPLE 4 Find y sin 4 x dx. SOLUTION We could evaluate this integral using the reduction formula for y sin n x dx (Equation 7.1.7) together with Example 3 (as in Exercise 7.1.47), but a better method is to write sin 4 x - ssin 2 xd 2 and use a half-angle formula: y sin 4 x dx - y ssin 2 xd 2 dx - y S 1 2 cos 2x 2 D 2 dx - 1 4 y s1 2 2 cos 2x 1 cos 2 2xd dx Since cos 2 2x occurs, we must use another half-angle formula cos 2 2x - 1 2 s1 1 cos 4xd This gives y sin 4 x dx - 1 4 y f 1 2 2 cos 2x 1 1 2 s1 1 cos 4xdg dx - 1 4 y ( 3 2 2 2 cos 2x 1 1 2 cos 4x) dx - 1 4 ( 3 2 x 2 sin 2x 1 1 8 sin 4x) 1 C ■ To summarize, we list guidelines to follow when evaluating integrals of the form y sin m x cos n x dx, where m > 0 and n > 0 are integers.

","SECTION 7.2 Trigonometric Integrals 481 Strategy for Evaluating y sin m x cos n x dx (a) If the power of cosine is odd sn - 2k 1 1d, save one cosine factor and use cos 2 x - 1 2 sin 2 x to express the remaining factors in terms of sine: y sin m x cos 2 k11 x dx - y sin m x scos 2 xd k cos x dx - y sin m x s1 2 sin 2 xd k cos x dx Then substitute u - sin x. (b) If the power of sine is odd sm - 2k 1 1d, save one sine factor and use sin 2 x - 1 2 cos 2 x to express the remaining factors in terms of cosine: y sin 2 k11 x cos n x dx - y ssin 2 xd k cos n x sin x dx - y s1 2 cos 2 xd k cos n x sin x dx Then substitute u - cos x. [Note that if the powers of both sine and cosine are odd, either (a) or (b) can be used.] (c) If the powers of both sine and cosine are even, use the half-angle identities sin 2 x - 1 2 s1 2 cos 2xd cos 2 x - 1 2 s1 1 cos 2xd It is sometimes helpful to use the identity sin x cos x - 1 2 sin 2x We can use a similar strategy to evaluate integrals of the form y tan m x sec n x dx. Since sdydxd tan x - sec 2 x, we can separate a sec 2 x factor and convert the remaining (even) power of secant to an expression involving tangent using the identity sec 2 x - 1 1 tan 2 x. Or, since sdydxd sec x - sec x tan x, we can separate a sec x tan x factor and convert the remaining (even) power of tangent to secant. EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate y tan 6 x sec 4 x dx. SOLUTION If we separate one sec 2 x factor, we can express the remaining sec 2 x factor in terms of tangent using the identity sec 2 x - 1 1 tan 2 x. We can then evaluate the integral by substituting u - tan x so that du - sec 2 x dx: y tan 6 x sec 4 x dx - y tan 6 x sec 2 x sec 2 x dx - y tan 6 x s1 1 tan 2 xd sec 2 x dx - y u 6 s1 1 u 2 d du - y su 6 1 u 8 d du - u 7 7 1 u 9 9 1 C - 1 7 tan 7 x 1 1 9 tan 9 x 1 C ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Strategy for Evaluating y tan m x sec n x dx (a) If the power of secant is even sn - 2k, k > 2d, save a factor of sec 2 x and use sec 2 x - 1 1 tan 2 x to express the remaining factors in terms of tan x: y tan m x sec 2 k x dx - y tan m x ssec 2 xd k21 sec 2 x dx - y tan m x s1 1 tan 2 xd k21 sec 2 x dx Then substitute u - tan x. (b) If the power of tangent is odd sm - 2k 1 1d, save a factor of sec x tan x and use tan 2 x - sec 2 x 2 1 to express the remaining factors in terms of sec x: y tan 2 k11 x sec n x dx - y stan 2 xd k sec n21 x sec x tan x dx - y ssec 2 x 2 1d k sec n21 x sec x tan x dx Then substitute u - sec x. For other cases, the guidelines are not as clear-cut. We may need to use identities, integration by parts, and occasionally a little ingenuity. We will sometimes need to be able to integrate tan x by using the formula established in (5.5.5): y tan x dx - ln | sec x | 1 C Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 7.2 Trigonometric Integrals 483 We will also need the indeinite integral of secant: y sec x dx - ln | sec x 1 tan x | 1 C We could verify Formula 1 by differentiating the right side, or as follows. First we mult- iply numerator and denominator by sec x 1 tan x: y sec x dx - y sec x sec x 1 tan x sec x 1 tan x dx - y sec 2 x 1 sec x tan x sec x 1 tan x dx If we substitute u - sec x 1 tan x, then du - ssec x tan x 1 sec 2 xd dx, so the integral becomes y s1 yud du - ln | u | 1 C. Thus we have y sec x dx - ln | sec x 1 tan x | 1 C EXAMPLE 7 Find y tan 3 x dx. SOLUTION Here only tan x occurs, so we use tan 2 x - sec 2 x 2 1 to rewrite a tan 2 x factor in terms of sec 2 x: y tan 3 x dx - y tan x tan 2 x dx - y tan x ssec 2 x 2 1d dx - y tan x sec 2 x dx 2 y tan x dx - tan 2 x 2 2 ln | sec x | 1 C In the irst integral we mentally substituted u - tan x so that du - sec 2 x dx. ■ If an even power of tangent appears with an odd power of secant, it is helpful to express the integrand completely in terms of sec x. Powers of sec x may require integra- tion by parts, as shown in the following example. EXAMPLE 8 Find y sec 3 x dx. SOLUTION Here we integrate by parts with u - sec x dv - sec 2 x dx du - sec x tan x dx v - tan x Then y sec 3 x dx - sec x tan x 2 y sec x tan 2 x dx - sec x tan x 2 y sec x ssec 2 x 2 1d dx - sec x tan x 2 y sec 3 x dx 1 y sec x dx 1 Formula 1 was discovered by James Gregory in 1668.

Integrals of the form y cot m x csc n x dx can be found by similar methods because of the identity 1 1 cot 2 x - csc 2 x. Finally, we can make use of another set of trigonometric identities: 2 To evaluate the integrals (a) y sin mx cos nx dx, (b) y sin mx sin nx dx, or (c) y cos mx cos nx dx, use the corresponding identity: (a) sin A cos B - 1 2 fsinsA 2 Bd 1 sinsA 1 Bdg (b) sin A sin B - 1 2 fcossA 2 Bd 2 cossA 1 Bdg (c) cos A cos B - 1 2 fcossA 2 Bd 1 cossA 1 Bdg EXAMPLE 9 Evaluate y sin 4x cos 5x dx.

In general, we can make a substitution of the form x - ts t d by using the Substitution Rule in reverse. To make our calculations simpler, we assume that t has an inverse func- tion; that is, t is one-to-one. In this case, if we replace u by x and x by t in the Substitution Rule (Equation 5.5.4), we obtain y f s xd dx - y f s tstdd t9 std dt This kind of substitution is called inverse substitution. We can make the inverse substitution x - a sin  provided that it deines a one-to-one function. This can be accomplished by restricting  to lie in the interval f2y2, y2g. In the following table we list trigonometric substitutions that are effective for the given radical expressions because of the speciied trigonometric identities. In each case the restriction on  is imposed to ensure that the function that deines the substitution is one-to-one. (These are the same intervals used in Section 1.5 in deining the inverse functions.)

But we usually use trigonometric substitutions because trigonometric identities are more familiar than hyper- bolic identities. EXAMPLE 6 Find y 3 s3 y2 0 x 3 s4x 2 1 9d 3y2 dx. SOLUTION First we note that s4x 2 1 9d 3y2 - ss4x 2 1 9 d 3 so trigonometric substitu- tion is appropriate. Although s4x 2 1 9 is not quite one of the expressions in the table of trigonometric substitutions, it becomes one of them if we make the preliminary substitution u - 2x.

Then du - dx and x - u 2 1, so y x s3 2 2x 2 x 2 dx - y u 2 1 s4 2 u 2 du As Example 6 shows, trigonometric substitution is sometimes a good idea when s x 2 1 a 2 d ny2 occurs in an integral, where n is any integer.

","SECTION 7.4 Integration of Rational Functions by Partial Fractions 493 In this section we show how to integrate any rational function (a ratio of polynomials) by expressing it as a sum of simpler fractions, called partial fractions, that we already know how to integrate. To illustrate the method, observe that by taking the fractions 2ys x 2 1d and 1 ys x 1 2d to a common denominator we obtain 2 x 2 1 2 1 x 1 2 - 2s x 1 2d 2 s x 2 1d s x 2 1ds x 1 2d - x 1 5 x 2 1 x 2 2 If we now reverse the procedure, we see how to integrate the function on the right side of this equation: y x 1 5 x 2 1 x 2 2 dx - y S 2 x 2 1 2 1 x 1 2 D dx - 2 ln | x 2 1 | 2 ln | x 1 2 | 1 C To see how the method of partial fractions works in general, let’s consider a rational function f s xd - Ps xd Qs xd where P and Q are polynomials. It’s possible to express f as a sum of simpler frac- tions provided that the degree of P is less than the degree of Q. Such a rational function is called proper. Recall that if Ps xd - a n x n 1 a n21 x n21 1 ∙∙∙ 1 a 1 x 1 a 0 where a n ± 0, then the degree of P is n and we write degsPd - n. If f is improper, that is, degsPd > degsQd, then we must take the preliminary step of dividing Q into P (by long division) until a remainder Rs xd is obtained such that degsRd , degsQd. The division statement is f s xd - Ps xd Qs xd - Ss xd 1 Rs xd Qs xd where S and R are also polynomials. As the following example illustrates, sometimes this preliminary step is all that is required. EXAMPLE 1 Find y x 3 1 x x 2 1 dx. SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denomi- nator , we irst perform the long division. This enables us to write y x 3 1 x x 2 1 dx - y S x 2 1 x 1 2 1 2 x 2 1 D dx - x 3 3 1 x 2 2 1 2x 1 2 ln | x 2 1 | 1 C ■ 1 x-1 ≈+x +2 ˛-≈ ≈+x ≈-x 2x 2x-2 2 ˛ +x ) Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","494 CHAPTER 7 Techniques of Integration In the case of an Equation 1 whose denominator is more complicated, the next step is to factor the denominator Qs xd as far as possible. It can be shown that any polyno- mial Q can be factored as a product of linear factors (of the form ax 1 bd and irreduc- ible quadratic factors (of the form ax 2 1 bx 1 c, where b 2 2 4ac , 0). For instance, if Qs xd - x 4 2 16, we could factor it as Qs xd - s x 2 2 4ds x 2 1 4d - s x 2 2ds x 1 2ds x 2 1 4d The third step is to express the proper rational function Rs xdyQs xd (from Equation 1) as a sum of partial fractions of the form A sax 1 bd i or Ax 1 B sax 2 1 bx 1 cd j A theorem in algebra guarantees that it is always possible to do this. We explain the details for the four cases that occur. CASE I The denominator Qs x d is a product of distinct linear factors. This means that we can write Qs xd - sa 1 x 1 b 1 dsa 2 x 1 b 2 d ∙∙∙ sa k x 1 b k d where no factor is repeated (and no factor is a constant multiple of another). In this case the partial fraction theorem states that there exist constants A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A k such that Rs xd Qs xd - A 1 a 1 x 1 b 1 1 A 2 a 2 x 1 b 2 1 ∙∙∙ 1 A k a k x 1 b k These constants can be determined as in the following example. EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate y x 2 1 2x 2 1 2x 3 1 3x 2 2 2x dx. SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denomina- tor, we don’t need to divide. We factor the denominator as 2x 3 1 3x 2 2 2x - x s2x 2 1 3x 2 2d - x s2x 2 1ds x 1 2d Since the denominator has three distinct linear factors, the partial fraction decomposi- tion of the integrand (2) has the form x 2 1 2x 2 1 x s2x 2 1ds x 1 2d - A x 1 B 2x 2 1 1 C x 1 2 To determine the values of A, B, and C, we multiply both sides of this equation by the product of the denominators, x s2x 2 1ds x 1 2d, obtaining x 2 1 2x 2 1 - As2x 2 1ds x 1 2d 1 Bx s x 1 2d 1 Cx s2x 2 1d Expanding the right side of Equation 4 and writing it in the standard form for poly- nomials, we get x 2 1 2x 2 1 - s2A 1 B 1 2C d x 2 1 s3A 1 2B 2 C d x 2 2A 2 3 Another method for inding A, B, and C is given in the note after this example. 4 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 7.4 Integration of Rational Functions by Partial Fractions 495 The polynomials in Equation 5 are identical, so their coeficients must be equal. The coeficient of x 2 on the right side, 2A 1 B 1 2C, must equal the coeficient of x 2 on the left side—namely, 1. Likewise, the coeficients of x are equal and the constant terms are equal. This gives the following system of equations for A, B, and C: 2 A 1 B 1 2C - 1 3A 1 2B 2 C - 2 22 A - 21 Solving, we get A - 1 2 , B - 1 5 , and C - 2 1 10 , and so y x 2 1 2x 2 1 2x 3 1 3x 2 2 2x dx - y S 1 2 1 x 1 1 5 1 2x 2 1 2 1 10 1 x 1 2 D dx - 1 2 ln | x | 1 1 10 ln | 2x 2 1 | 2 1 10 ln | x 1 2 | 1 K In integrating the middle term we have made the mental substitution u - 2x 2 1, which gives du - 2 dx and dx - 1 2 du. ■ NOTE We can use an alternative method to ind the coeficients A, B, and C in Exam- ple 2. Equation 4 is an identity; it is true for every value of x. Let’s choose values of x that simplify the equation. If we put x - 0 in Equation 4, then the second and third terms on the right side vanish and the equation then becomes 22A - 21, or A - 1 2 . Likewise, x - 1 2 gives 5By4 - 1 4 and x - 22 gives 10C - 21, so B - 1 5 and C - 2 1 10 .

See Exercise 73 for the reason.) EXAMPLE 3 Find y dx x 2 2 a 2 , where a ± 0. SOLUTION The method of partial fractions gives 1 x 2 2 a 2 - 1 s x 2 ads x 1 ad - A x 2 a 1 B x 1 a and therefore As x 1 ad 1 Bs x 2 ad - 1 Using the method of the preceding note, we put x - a in this equation and get As2ad - 1, so A - 1 ys2ad.

Suppose the irst linear factor sa 1 x 1 b 1 d is repeated r times; that is, sa 1 x 1 b 1 d r occurs in the factorization of Qs xd. Then instead of the single term A 1 ysa 1 x 1 b 1 d in Equation 2, we would use A 1 a 1 x 1 b 1 1 A 2 sa 1 x 1 b 1 d 2 1 ∙∙∙ 1 A r sa 1 x 1 b 1 d r By way of illustration, we could write x 3 2 x 1 1 x 2 s x 2 1d 3 - A x 1 B x 2 1 C x 2 1 1 D s x 2 1d 2 1 E s x 2 1d 3 but we prefer to work out in detail a simpler example. EXAMPLE 4 Find y x 4 2 2x 2 1 4x 1 1 x 3 2 x 2 2 x 1 1 dx. SOLUTION The irst step is to divide.

If Qs xd has the factor ax 2 1 bx 1 c, where b 2 2 4ac , 0, then, in addition to the partial fractions in Equations 2 and 7, the expression for Rs xdyQs xd will have a term of the form Ax 1 B ax 2 1 bx 1 c where A and B are constants to be determined.

To integrate the given function we complete the square in the denominator: 4x 2 2 4x 1 3 - s2x 2 1d 2 1 2 This suggests that we make the substitution u - 2x 2 1.

In general, we might get a term of the form 1ys x 2 1 1d 2 . One way to integrate such a term is to make the substitution x - tan  . Another method is to use the formula in Exercise 72. Sometimes partial fractions can be avoided when integrating a rational function. For instance, although the integral y x 2 1 1 x s x 2 1 3d dx could be evaluated by using the method of Case III, it’s much easier to observe that if u - x s x 2 1 3d - x 3 1 3x, then du - s3x 2 1 3d dx and so y x 2 1 1 x s x 2 1 3d dx - 1 3 ln | x 3 1 3x | 1 C Rationalizing Substitutions Some nonrational functions can be changed into rational functions by means of appro- priate substitutions. In particular, when an integrand contains an expression of the form s n t s xd , then the substitution u - s n ts xd may be effective. Other instances appear in the exercises. EXAMPLE 9 Evaluate y sx 1 4 x dx . SOLUTION Let u - sx 1 4 . Then u 2 - x 1 4, so x - u 2 2 4 and dx - 2u du.

For instance, we usu ally used substitution in Exercises 5.5, integration by parts in Exercises 7.1, and par- tial fractions in Exercises 7.4. But in this section we present a collection of miscella- neous integrals in random order and the main challenge is to recognize which technique or formula to use. No hard and fast rules can be given as to which method applies in a given situation, but we give some advice on strategy that you may find useful. A prerequisite for applying a strategy is a knowledge of the basic integration formu- las. In the following table we have collected the integrals from our previous list together with several additional formulas that we have learned in this chapter.

","504 CHAPTER 7 Techniques of Integration Most of these formulas should be memorized. It is useful to know them all, but the ones marked with an asterisk need not be memorized since they are easily derived. For- mula 19 can be avoided by using partial fractions, and trigonometric substitutions can be used in place of Formula 20. Once you are armed with these basic integration formulas, if you don’t immediately see how to attack a given integral, you might try the following four-step strategy. 1. Simplify the Integrand if Possible Sometimes the use of algebraic manipulation or trigonometric identities will simplify the integrand and make the method of integration obvious. Here are some examples: y s x (1 1 s x ) dx - y ( s x 1 x) dx y tan  sec 2  d - y sin  cos  cos 2  d - y sin  cos  d - 1 2 y sin 2 d y ssin x 1 cos xd 2 dx - y ssin 2 x 1 2 sin x cos x 1 cos 2 xd dx - y s1 1 2 sin x cos xd dx 2. Look for an Obvious Substitution Try to ind some function u - ts xd in the integrand whose differential du - t9 s xd dx also occurs, apart from a constant factor. For instance, in the integral y x x 2 2 1 dx we notice that if u - x 2 2 1, then du - 2x dx. Therefore we use the substitution u - x 2 2 1 instead of the method of partial fractions. 3. Classify the Integrand According to Its Form If Steps 1 and 2 have not led to the solu- tion, then we take a look at the form of the integrand f s xd. (a) Trigonometric functions. If f s xd is a product of powers of sin x and cos x, of tan x and sec x, or of cot x and csc x, then we use the substitutions recommended in Section 7.2. (b) Rational functions. If f is a rational function, we use the procedure of Section 7.4 involving partial fractions. (c) Integration by parts. If f s xd is a product of a power of x (or a polynomial) and a transcendental function (such as a trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic func- tion), then we try integration by parts, choosing u and dv according to the advice given in Section 7.1. If you look at the functions in Exercises 7.1, you will see that most of them are the type just described. (d) Radicals. Particular kinds of substitutions are recommended when certain radicals appear. (i) If s6x 2 6 a 2 occurs, we use a trigonometric substitution according to the table in Section 7.3. (ii) If s n ax 1 b occurs, we use the rationalizing substitution u - s n ax 1 b . More generally, this sometimes works for s n ts xd . Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Try Again If the irst three steps have not produced the answer, remember that there are basically only two methods of integration: substitution and parts. (a) Try substitution. Even if no substitution is obvious (Step 2), some inspiration or ingenuity (or even desperation) may suggest an appropriate substitution. (b) Try parts. Although integration by parts is used most of the time on products of the form described in Step 3(c), it is sometimes effective on single functions. Look- ing at Section 7.1, we see that it works on tan 21 x, sin 21 x, and ln x, and these are all inverse functions. (c) Manipulate the integrand. Algebraic manipulations (perhaps rationalizing the denominator or using trigonometric identities) may be useful in transforming the integral into an easier form. These manipulations may be more substantial than in Step 1 and may involve some ingenuity. Here is an example: y dx 1 2 cos x - y 1 1 2 cos x ? 1 1 cos x 1 1 cos x dx - y 1 1 cos x 1 2 cos 2 x dx - y 1 1 cos x sin 2 x dx - y S csc 2 x 1 cos x sin 2 x D dx (d) Relate the problem to previous problems. When you have built up some experience in integration, you may be able to use a method on a given integral that is similar to a method you have already used on a previous integral. Or you may even be able to express the given integral in terms of a previous one. For instance, y tan 2 x sec x dx is a challenging integral, but if we make use of the identity tan 2 x - sec 2 x 2 1, we can write y tan 2 x sec x dx - y sec 3 x dx 2 y sec x dx and if y sec 3 x dx has previously been evaluated (see Example 7.2.8), then that cal- culation can be used in the present problem. (e) Use several methods. Sometimes two or three methods are required to evaluate an integral. The evaluation could involve several successive substitutions of different types, or it might combine integration by parts with one or more substitutions. In the following examples we indicate a method of attack but do not fully work out the integral. EXAMPLE 1 y tan 3 x cos 3 x dx In Step 1 we rewrite the integral: y tan 3 x cos 3 x dx - y tan 3 x sec 3 x dx The integral is now of the form y tan m x sec n x dx with m odd, so we can use the advice in Section 7.2. Alternatively, if in Step 1 we had written y tan 3 x cos 3 x dx - y sin 3 x cos 3 x 1 cos 3 x dx - y sin 3 x cos 6 x dx Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","506 CHAPTER 7 Techniques of Integration then we could have continued as follows with the substitution u - cos x: y sin 3 x cos 6 x dx - y 1 2 cos 2 x cos 6 x sin x dx - y 1 2 u 2 u 6 s2dud - y u 2 2 1 u 6 du - y su 24 2 u 26 d du ■ EXAMPLE 2 y e sx dx According to (ii) in Step 3(d), we substitute u - sx . Then x - u 2 , so dx - 2u du and y e sx dx - 2 y ue u du The integrand is now a product of u and the transcendental function e u so it can be integrated by parts. ■ EXAMPLE 3 y x 5 1 1 x 3 2 3x 2 2 10x dx No algebraic simpliication or substitution is obvious, so Steps 1 and 2 don’t apply here. The integrand is a rational function so we apply the procedure of Section 7.4, remembering that the irst step is to divide. ■ EXAMPLE 4 y dx x sln x Here Step 2 is all that is needed. We substitute u - ln x because its differential is du - dxyx, which occurs in the integral. ■ EXAMPLE 5 y Î 1 2 x 1 1 x dx Although the rationalizing substitution u - Î 1 2 x 1 1 x works here [(ii) in Step 3(d)], it leads to a very complicated rational function. An easier method is to do some algebraic manipulation [either as Step 1 or as Step 4(c)]. Multi- plying numerator and denominator by s1 2 x , we have y Î 1 2 x 1 1 x dx - y 1 2 x s 1 2 x 2 dx - y 1 s1 2 x 2 dx 2 y x s1 2 x 2 dx - sin 21 x 1 s1 2 x 2 1 C ■ Can We Integrate All Continuous Functions? The question arises: Will our strategy for integration enable us to ind the integral of every continuous function? For example, can we use it to evaluate y e x 2 dx? The answer is No, at least not in terms of the functions that we are familiar with. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

These are the polynomials, rational functions, power functions s x n d, exponen- tial functions sb x d, logarithmic functions, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric func- tions, hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, and all functions that can be obtained from these by the ive operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composition. For instance, the function f s xd - Î x 2 2 1 x 3 1 2x 2 1 1 lnscosh xd 2 xe sin 2 x is an elementary function. If f is an elementary function, then f 9 is an elementary function but y f s xd dx need not be an elementary function. Consider f s xd - e x 2 . Since f is continuous, its integral exists, and if we deine the function F by Fs xd - y x 0 e t 2 dt then we know from Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that F9 s xd - e x 2 Thus f s xd - e x 2 has an antiderivative F, but it has been proved that F is not an elementary function. This means that no matter how hard we try, we will never succeed in evaluating y e x 2 dx in terms of the functions we know. (In Chapter 11, however, we will see how to express y e x 2 dx as an ininite series.) The same can be said of the following integrals: y e x x dx y sins x 2 d dx y cosse x d dx y sx 3 1 1 dx y 1 ln x dx y sin x x dx In fact, the majority of elementary functions don’t have elementary antiderivatives. You may be assured, though, that the integrals in the following exercises are all elementary functions. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 7.6 Integration Using Tables and Computer Algebra Systems 509 the most powerful computer algebra systems can’t ind explicit formulas for the antideriv- atives of functions like e x 2 or the other functions described at the end of Section 7.5. Tables of Integrals Tables of indeinite integrals are very useful when we are confronted by an integral that is dificult to evaluate by hand and we don’t have access to a computer algebra system. A relatively brief table of 120 integrals, categorized by form, is provided on the Reference Pages at the back of the book. More extensive tables are available in the CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae, 31st ed. by Daniel Zwillinger (Boca Raton, FL, 2002) (709 entries) or in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik’s Table of Integrals, Series, and Products, 7e (San Diego, 2007), which contains hundreds of pages of integrals. It should be remembered, however, that integrals do not often occur in exactly the form listed in a table. Usually we need to use the Substitution Rule or algebraic manipulation to transform a given integral into one of the forms in the table.

Computers are particularly good at matching patterns. And just as we used substitutions in conjunction with tables, a CAS can perform substitutions that transform a given integral into one that occurs in its stored formulas. So it isn’t surprising that computer algebra systems excel at integration. That doesn’t mean that integration by hand is an obsolete skill. We will see that a hand computation sometimes produces an indeinite integral in a form that is more convenient than a machine answer. To begin, let’s see what happens when we ask a machine to integrate the relatively simple function y - 1 ys3x 2 2d. Using the substitution u - 3x 2 2, an easy calcula- tion by hand gives y 1 3x 2 2 dx - 1 3 ln | 3x 2 2 | 1 C whereas Mathematica and Maple both return the answer 1 3 lns3x 2 2d The irst thing to notice is that computer algebra systems omit the constant of integra- tion. In other words, they produce a particular antiderivative, not the most general one. Therefore, when making use of a machine integration, we might have to add a con- stant. Second, the absolute value signs are omitted in the machine answer. That is ine if our problem is concerned only with values of x greater than 2 3 . But if we are interested in other values of x, then we need to insert the absolute value symbol. In the next example we reconsider the integral of Example 4, but this time we ask a machine for the answer. EXAMPLE 5 Use a computer algebra system to ind y x sx 2 1 2x 1 4 dx.

There may be no formula for the function (see Example 5). In both cases we need to ind approximate values of deinite integrals. We already know one such method. Recall that the deinite integral is deined as a limit of Riemann sums, so any Riemann sum could be used as an approximation to the integral: If we divide fa, bg into n subintervals of equal length Dx - sb 2 adyn, then we have y b a f s xd dx < o n i-1 f s x i * d Dx where x i * is any point in the ith subinterval fx i21 , x i g. If x i * is chosen to be the left end- point of the interval, then x i * - x i21 and we have y b a f s xd dx < L n - o n i-1 f s x i21 d Dx If f s xd > 0, then the integral represents an area and (1) represents an approximation of this area by the rectangles shown in Figure 1(a). If we choose x i * to be the right endpoint, then x i * - x i and we have y b a f s xd dx < R n - o n i-1 f s x i d Dx [See Figure 1(b).] The approximations L n and R n defined by Equations 1 and 2 are called the left endpoint approximation and right endpoint approximation, respectively. In Section 5.2 we also considered the case where x i * is chosen to be the midpoint x i of the subinterval fx i21 , x i g. Figure 1(c) shows the midpoint approximation M n , which appears to be better than either L n or R n .

The reason for the name Trapezoidal Rule can be seen from Figure 2, which illustrates the case with f s xd > 0 and n - 4. The area of the trapezoid that lies above the ith sub- interval is Dx S f s x i21 d 1 f s x i d 2 D - Dx 2 f f s x i21 d 1 f s x i dg and if we add the areas of all these trapezoids, we get the right side of the Trapezoidal Rule. EXAMPLE 1 Use (a) the Trapezoidal Rule and (b) the Midpoint Rule with n - 5 to approximate the integral y 2 1 s1 yxd dx. SOLUTION (a) With n - 5, a - 1, and b - 2, we have Dx - s2 2 1dy5 - 0.2, and so the Trape- zoidal Rule gives y 2 1 1 x dx < T 5 - 0.2 2 f f s1d 1 2 f s1.2d 1 2 f s1.4d 1 2 f s1.6d 1 2 f s1.8d 1 f s2dg - 0.1 S 1 1 1 2 1.2 1 2 1.4 1 2 1.6 1 2 1.8 1 1 2 D < 0.695635 This approximation is illustrated in Figure 3.

In all of the methods we get more accurate approximations when we increase the value of n. (But very large values of n result in so many arithmetic operations that we have to beware of accumulated round-off error.) 2. The errors in the left and right endpoint approximations are opposite in sign and appear to decrease by a factor of about 2 when we double the value of n. 3. The Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are much more accurate than the endpoint approximations. 4. The errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are opposite in sign and appear to decrease by a factor of about 4 when we double the value of n. 5. The size of the error in the Midpoint Rule is about half the size of the error in the Trapezoidal Rule. Figure 5 shows why we can usually expect the Midpoint Rule to be more accurate than the Trapezoidal Rule. The area of a typical rectangle in the Midpoint Rule is the same as the area of the trapezoid ABCD whose upper side is tangent to the graph at P . The area of this trapezoid is closer to the area under the graph than is the area of the trap- ezoid AQRD used in the Trapezoidal Rule. [The midpoint error (shaded red) is smaller than the trapezoidal error (shaded blue).] These observations are corroborated in the following error estimates, which are proved in books on numerical analysis. Notice that Observation 4 corresponds to the n 2 in each denominator because s2nd 2 - 4n 2 . The fact that the estimates depend on the size of the second derivative is not surprising if you look at Figure 5, because f 0s xd measures how much the graph is curved. [Recall that f 0s xd measures how fast the slope of y - f s xd changes.] TEC Module 5.2 / 7.7 allows you to compare approximation methods. Approximations to y 2 1 1 x dx It turns out that these observations are true in most cases. C P D A B R Q C P D A B x i-1 x i i-1 x – i FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","518 CHAPTER 7 Techniques of Integration 3 Error Bounds Suppose | f 0s xd | < K for a < x < b. If E T and E M are the errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules, then | E T | < Ksb 2 ad 3 12n 2 and | E M | < Ksb 2 ad 3 24n 2 Let’s apply this error estimate to the Trapezoidal Rule approximation in Example 1. If f s xd - 1 yx, then f 9 s xd - 21 yx 2 and f 0s xd - 2yx 3 . Because 1 < x < 2, we have 1 yx < 1, so | f 0s xd | - Z 2 x 3 Z < 2 1 3 - 2 Therefore, taking K - 2, a - 1, b - 2, and n - 5 in the error estimate (3), we see that | E T | < 2s2 2 1d 3 12s5d 2 - 1 150 < 0.006667 Comparing this error estimate of 0.006667 with the actual error of about 0.002488, we see that it can happen that the actual error is substantially less than the upper bound for the error given by (3). EXAMPLE 2 How large should we take n in order to guarantee that the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rule approximations for y 2 1 s1 yxd dx are accurate to within 0.0001? SOLUTION We saw in the preceding calculation that | f 0s xd | < 2 for 1 < x < 2, so we can take K - 2, a - 1, and b - 2 in (3). Accuracy to within 0.0001 means that the size of the error should be less than 0.0001. Therefore we choose n so that 2s1d 3 12n 2 , 0.0001 Solving the inequality for n, we get n 2 . 2 12s0.0001d or n . 1 s0.0006 < 40.8 Thus n - 41 will ensure the desired accuracy. For the same accuracy with the Midpoint Rule we choose n so that 2s1d 3 24n 2 , 0.0001 and so n . 1 s0.0012 < 29 ■ K can be any number larger than all the values of | f 0s xd | , but smaller values of K give better error bounds. It’s quite possible that a lower value for n would sufice, but 41 is the smallest value for which the error bound formula can guarantee us accuracy to within 0.0001. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Then on each consecutive pair of intervals we approximate the curve y - f s xd > 0 by a parabola as shown in Figure 7.

It turns out (see Exercise 50) that the approximations in Simpson’s Rule are weighted averages of those in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules: S 2 n - 1 3 T n 1 2 3 M n (Recall that E T and E M usually have opposite signs and | E M | is about half the size of | E T | .) In many applications of calculus we need to evaluate an integral even if no explicit formula is known for y as a function of x. A function may be given graphically or as a table of values of collected data. If there is evidence that the values are not changing rapidly, then the Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson’ s Rule can still be used to ind an approxi- mate value for y b a y dx, the integral of y with respect to x.

","SECTION 7.7 Approximate Integration 523 SOLUTION If f s xd - 1 yx, then f s4d s xd - 24y x 5 . Since x > 1, we have 1 yx < 1 and so | f s4d s xd | - Z 24 x 5 Z < 24 Therefore we can take K - 24 in (4).

Some of these machines use Simpson’s Rule; others use more sophis- ticated techniques such as adaptive numerical integration. This means that if a function luctuates much more on a certain part of the interval than it does elsewhere, then that part gets divided into more subintervals. This strategy reduces the number of calculations required to achieve a prescribed accuracy. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In deining a deinite integral y b a f s xd dx we dealt with a function f deined on a inite interval fa, bg and we assumed that f does not have an ininite discontinuity (see Sec- tion 5.2). In this section we extend the concept of a deinite integral to the case where the interval is ininite and also to the case where f has an ininite discontinuity in fa, bg. In either case the integral is called an improper integral. One of the most important applica- tions of this idea, probability distributions, will be studied in Section 8.5. Type 1: Infinite Intervals Consider the ininite region S that lies under the curve y - 1 yx 2 , above the x-axis, and to the right of the line x - 1. You might think that, since S is infinite in extent, its area must be infinite, but let’s take a closer look. The area of the part of S that lies to the left of the line x - t (shaded in Figure 1) is Astd - y t 1 1 x 2 dx - 2 1 x G 1 t - 1 2 1 t Notice that Astd , 1 no matter how large t is chosen. We also observe that lim t l ` Astd - lim t l ` S 1 2 1 t D - 1 The area of the shaded region approaches 1 as t l ` (see Figure 2), so we say that the area of the infinite region S is equal to 1 and we write y ` 1 1 x 2 dx - lim t l ` y t 1 1 x 2 dx - 1 0 y x 1 2 area= 1 2 0 y x 1 3 area= 2 3 0 y x 1 area=1 0 y x 1 5 4 5 area= 0 y x 1 t y= x=1 area=1- =1 1 t 1 ≈ FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","528 CHAPTER 7 Techniques of Integration Using this example as a guide, we deine the integral of f (not necessarily a positive function) over an ininite interval as the limit of integrals over inite intervals. 1 Deinition of an Improper Integral of Type 1 (a) If y t a f s xd dx exists for every number t > a, then y ` a f s xd dx - lim t l ` y t a f s xd dx provided this limit exists (as a inite number). (b) If y b t f s xd dx exists for every number t < b, then y b 2` f s xd dx - lim t l2` y b t f s xd dx provided this limit exists (as a inite number). The improper integrals y ` a f s xd dx and y b 2` f s xd dx are called convergent if the corresponding limit exists and divergent if the limit does not exist. (c) If both y ` a f s xd dx and y a 2` f s xd dx are convergent, then we deine y ` 2` f s xd dx - y a 2` f s xd dx 1 y ` a f s xd dx In part (c) any real number a can be used (see Exercise 76). Any of the improper integrals in Deinition 1 can be interpreted as an area provided that f is a positive function. For instance, in case (a) if f s xd > 0 and the integral y ` a f s xd dx is convergent, then we define the area of the region S - hs x, yd | x > a, 0 < y < f s xdj in Figure 3 to be AsS d - y ` a f s xd dx This is appropriate because y ` a f s xd dx is the limit as t l ` of the area under the graph of f from a to t. 0 y x a S y=ƒ EXAMPLE 1 Determine whether the integral y ` 1 s1 yxd dx is convergent or divergent.

","SECTION 7.8 Improper Integrals 531 We summarize the result of Example 4 for future reference: 2 y ` 1 1 x p dx is convergent if p . 1 and divergent if p < 1. Type 2: Discontinuous Integrands Suppose that f is a positive continuous function deined on a inite interval fa, bd but has a vertical asymptote at b. Let S be the unbounded region under the graph of f and above the x-axis between a and b. (For Type 1 integrals, the regions extended indefinitely in a horizontal direction. Here the region is infinite in a vertical direction.) The area of the part of S between a and t (the shaded region in Figure 7) is Astd - y t a f s xd dx If it happens that Astd approaches a definite number A as t l b 2 , then we say that the area of the region S is A and we write y b a f s xd dx - lim t lb 2 y t a f s xd dx We use this equation to define an improper integral of Type 2 even when f is not a posi- tive function, no matter what type of discontinuity f has at b. 3 Deinition of an Improper Integral of Type 2 (a) If f is continuous on fa, bd and is discontinuous at b, then y b a f s xd dx - lim t lb 2 y t a f s xd dx if this limit exists (as a finite number). (b) If f is continuous on sa, bg and is discontinuous at a, then y b a f s xd dx - lim t l a 1 y b t f s xd dx if this limit exists (as a finite number). The improper integral y b a f s xd dx is called convergent if the corresponding limit exists and divergent if the limit does not exist. (c) If f has a discontinuity at c, where a , c , b, and both y c a f s xd dx and y b c f s xd dx are convergent, then we define y b a f s xd dx - y c a f s xd dx 1 y b c f s xd dx EXAMPLE 5 Find y 5 2 1 sx 2 2 dx.

SOLUTION Note that the given integral is improper because lim x lsy2d 2 sec x - `. Using part (a) of Deinition 3 and Formula 14 from the Table of Integrals, we have y y2 0 sec x dx - lim t lsy2d 2 y t 0 sec x dx - lim t lsy2d 2 ln | sec x 1 tan x | g 0 t - lim t lsy2d 2 flnssec t 1 tan td 2 ln 1g - ` because sec t l ` and tan t l ` as t l sy2d 2 . Thus the given improper integral is divergent. ■ EXAMPLE 7 Evaluate y 3 0 dx x 2 1 if possible. SOLUTION Observe that the line x - 1 is a vertical asymptote of the integrand. Since it occurs in the middle of the interval f0, 3g, we must use part (c) of Deinition 3 with c - 1: y 3 0 dx x 2 1 - y 1 0 dx x 2 1 1 y 3 1 dx x 2 1 where y 1 0 dx x 2 1 - lim t l1 2 y t 0 dx x 2 1 - lim t l1 2 ln | x 2 1 | g 0 t - lim t l1 2 (ln | t 2 1 | 2 ln | 21 | ) - lim t l1 2 lns1 2 td - 2` because 1 2 t l 0 1 as t l 1 2 . Thus y 1 0 dxys x 2 1d is divergent. This implies that y 3 0 dxys x 2 1d is divergent. [We do not need to evaluate y 3 1 dxys x 2 1d.] ■ WARNING If we had not noticed the asymptote x - 1 in Example 7 and had instead confused the integral with an ordinary integral, then we might have made the following erroneous calculation: y 3 0 dx x 2 1 - ln | x 2 1 | g 3 0 - ln 2 2 ln 1 - ln 2 This is wrong because the integral is improper and must be calculated in terms of limits. From now on, whenever you meet the symbol y b a f s xd dx you must decide, by looking at the function f on fa, bg, whether it is an ordinary deinite integral or an improper integral.

The area of the shaded region above y - ln x and below the x-axis is 1. ■ A Comparison Test for Improper Integrals Sometimes it is impossible to ind the exact value of an improper integral and yet it is important to know whether it is convergent or divergent. In such cases the following theorem is useful. Although we state it for Type 1 integrals, a similar theorem is true for Type 2 integrals. Comparison Theorem Suppose that f and t are continuous functions with f s xd > ts xd > 0 for x > a. (a) If y ` a f s xd dx is convergent, then y ` a ts xd dx is convergent. (b) If y ` a ts xd dx is divergent, then y ` a f s xd dx is divergent. We omit the proof of the Comparison Theorem, but Figure 12 makes it seem plau- sible. If the area under the top curve y - f s xd is inite, then so is the area under the bottom curve y - ts xd. And if the area under y - ts xd is ininite, then so is the area under y - f s xd. [Note that the reverse is not necessarily true: If y ` a ts xd dx is convergent, y ` a f s xd dx may or may not be convergent, and if y ` a f s xd dx is divergent, y ` a ts xd dx may or may not be divergent.] EXAMPLE 9 Show that y ` 0 e 2x 2 dx is convergent. SOLUTION We can’t evaluate the integral directly because the antiderivative of e 2x 2 is not an elementary function (as explained in Section 7.5). We write y ` 0 e 2x 2 dx - y 1 0 e 2x 2 dx 1 y ` 1 e 2x 2 dx and observe that the irst integral on the right-hand side is just an ordinary deinite inte- gral. In the second integral we use the fact that for x > 1 we have x 2 > x, so 2x 2 <2x and therefore e 2x 2 < e 2x . (See Figure 13.) The integral of e 2x is easy to evaluate: y ` 1 e 2x dx - lim t l` y t 1 e 2x dx - lim t l` se 21 2 e 2t d - e 21 0 y x 1 area=1 y=ln x FIGURE 11 0 y x a g f FIGURE 12 0 y x 1 y=e _x y=e _x 2 FIGURE 13 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","534 CHAPTER 7 Techniques of Integration Therefore, taking f s xd - e 2x and ts xd - e 2x 2 in the Comparison Theorem, we see that y ` 1 e 2x 2 dx is convergent. It follows that y ` 0 e 2x 2 dx is convergent. ■ In Example 9 we showed that y ` 0 e 2x 2 dx is convergent without computing its value. In Exercise 72 we indicate how to show that its value is approximately 0.8862. In probability theory it is important to know the exact value of this improper integral, as we will see in Section 8.5; using the methods of multivariable calculus it can be shown that the exact value is s  y2. Table 1 illustrates the deinition of an improper integral by showing how the (computer-generated) values of y t 0 e 2x 2 dx approach s  y2 as t becomes large. In fact, these values converge quite quickly because e 2x 2 l 0 very rapidly as x l `.

Dialysis treatment removes urea and other waste products from a patient’s blood by diverting some of the bloodlow externally through a machine called a dialyzer. The rate at which urea is removed from the blood (in mgymin) is often well described by the equation ustd - r V C0e 2rtyV where r is the rate of low of blood through the dialyzer (in mLymin), V is the volume of the patient’s blood (in mL), and C0 is the amount of urea in the blood (in mg) at time t - 0.

SOLUTION (a) At irst sight, the given equation may appear somewhat bafling. How is it possible to connect the left side to the right side? Connections can often be made through one of the principles of problem solving: introduce something extra. Here the extra ingredi- ent is a new variable. We often think of introducing a new variable when we use the Substitution Rule to integrate a speciic function. But that technique is still useful in the present circumstance in which we have a general function f . Once we think of making a substitution, the form of the right side suggests that it should be u - a 2 x. Then du - 2dx. When x - 0, u - a; when x - a, u - 0. So y a 0 f sa 2 xd dx - 2 y 0 a f sud du - y a 0 f sud du But this integral on the right side is just another way of writing y a 0 f s xd dx. So the given equation is proved. (b) If we let the given integral be I and apply part (a) with a - y2, we get I - y y2 0 sin n x sin n x 1 cos n x dx - y y2 0 sin n sy2 2 xd sin n sy2 2 xd 1 cos n sy2 2 xd dx A well-known trigonometric identity tells us that sinsy2 2 xd - cos x and cossy2 2 xd - sin x, so we get I - y y2 0 cos n x cos n x 1 sin n x dx Notice that the two expressions for I are very similar. In fact, the integrands have the same denominator. This suggests that we should add the two expressions. If we do so, we get 2I - y y2 0 sin n x 1 cos n x sin n x 1 cos n x dx - y y2 0 1 dx -  2 Therefore I - y4. ■ Cover up the solution to the example and try it yourself irst.

","544 CHAPTER 8 Further Applications of Integration What do we mean by the length of a curve? We might think of itting a piece of string to the curve in Figure 1 and then measuring the string against a ruler. But that might be dif- icult to do with much accuracy if we have a complicated curve. We need a precise deini- tion for the length of an arc of a curve, in the same spirit as the deinitions we developed for the concepts of area and volume. If the curve is a polygon, we can easily ind its length; we just add the lengths of the line segments that form the polygon. (We can use the distance formula to ind the distance between the endpoints of each segment.) We are going to deine the length of a general curve by irst approximating it by a polygon and then taking a limit as the number of seg- ments of the polygon is increased. This process is familiar for the case of a circle, where the circumference is the limit of lengths of inscribed polygons (see Figure 2). Now suppose that a curve C is deined by the equation y - f s xd, where f is continuous and a < x < b. We obtain a polygonal approximation to C by dividing the interval fa, bg into n subintervals with endpoints x 0 , x 1 ,..., x n and equal width Dx. If y i - f s x i d, then the point P i s x i , y i d lies on C and the polygon with vertices P 0 , P 1 , . . . , P n , illustrated in Figure 3, is an approximation to C. y P¸ P¡ P™ P i-1 P i P n y=ƒ 0 x i ¤ i-1 b x¡ a x x The length L of C is approximately the length of this polygon and the approximation gets better as we let n increase. (See Figure 4, where the arc of the curve between P i21  and P i  has been magniied and approximations with successively smaller values of Dx are shown.) Therefore we deine the length L of the curve C with equation y - f s xd, a < x < b, as the limit of the lengths of these inscribed polygons (if the limit exists): L - lim n l ` o n i-1 | P i21 P i | Notice that the procedure for deining arc length is very similar to the procedure we used for deining area and volume: We divided the curve into a large number of small parts. We then found the approximate lengths of the small parts and added them. Finally, we took the limit as n l `. The deinition of arc length given by Equation 1 is not very convenient for compu- tational purposes, but we can derive an integral formula for L in the case where f has a continuous derivative. [Such a function f is called smooth because a small change in x produces a small change in f 9 s xd.] If we let Dy i - y i 2 y i21 , then | P i21 P i | - ss x i 2 x i21 d 2 1 s y i 2 y i21 d 2 - ssDxd 2 1 sDy i d 2 FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 FIGURE 3 P i-1 P i P i-1 P i P i-1 P i P i-1 P i FIGURE 4 1 TEC Visual 8.1 shows an animation of Figure 2.

","SECTION 8.1 Arc Length 545 By applying the Mean Value Theorem to f on the interval fx i21 , x i g, we ind that there is a number x i * between x i21 and x i such that f s x i d 2 f s x i21 d - f 9 s x i * ds x i 2 x i21 d that is, Dy i - f 9 s x i * d Dx Thus we have | P i21 P i | - ssDxd 2 1 sDy i d 2 - ssDxd 2 1 f f 9 s x i * d Dxg 2 - s1 1 [ f 9 s x i * dg 2 ssDxd 2 - s1 1 f f 9 s x i * dg 2 Dx (since Dx . 0) Therefore, by Deinition 1, L - lim nl` o n i-1 | P i21 P i | - lim nl` o n i-1 s1 1 f f 9 s x i * dg 2 Dx We recognize this expression as being equal to y b a s1 1 f f 9 s xdg 2 dx by the deinition of a deinite integral.

","SECTION 8.1 Arc Length 547 Because of the presence of the square root sign in Formulas 2 and 4, the calculation of an arc length often leads to an integral that is very dificult or even impossible to evaluate explicitly. Thus we sometimes have to be content with inding an approximation to the length of a curve, as in the following example. EXAMPLE 3 (a) Set up an integral for the length of the arc of the hyperbola xy - 1 from the point s1, 1d to the point s2, 1 2 d. (b) Use Simpson’s Rule with n - 10 to estimate the arc length.

Thus if a smooth curve C has the equation y - f s xd, a < x < b, let ss xd be the distance along C from the initial point P 0 sa, f sadd to the point Qs x, f s xdd. Then s is a function, called the arc length function, and, by Formula 2, ss xd - y x a s1 1 f f 9 s t dg 2 dt (We have replaced the variable of integration by t so that x does not have two meanings.) We can use Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to differentiate Equation 5 (since the integrand is continuous): ds dx - s1 1 f f 9 s xdg 2 - Î 1 1 S dy dx D 2 Equation 6 shows that the rate of change of s with respect to x is always at least 1 and is equal to 1 when f 9 s xd, the slope of the curve, is 0. The differential of arc length is ds - Î 1 1 S dy dx D 2 dx Checking the value of the deinite inte- gral with a more accurate approxima- tion produced by a computing device, we see that the approximation using Simpson’s Rule is accurate to four decimal places. 5 6 7 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 8.2 Area of a Surface of Revolution 551 A surface of revolution is formed when a curve is rotated about a line. Such a surface is the lateral boundary of a solid of revolution of the type discussed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. We want to deine the area of a surface of revolution in such a way that it corresponds to our intuition. If the surface area is A, we can imagine that painting the surface would require the same amount of paint as does a lat region with area A. Let’s start with some simple surfaces. The lateral surface area of a circular cylinder with radius r and height h is taken to be A - 2rh because we can imagine cutting the cylinder and unrolling it (as in Figure 1) to obtain a rectangle with dimensions 2r and h. Likewise, we can take a circular cone with base radius r and slant height l, cut it along the dashed line in Figure 2, and latten it to form a sector of a circle with radius l and central angle  - 2r yl. We know that, in general, the area of a sector of a circle with radius l and angle  is 1 2 l 2  (see Exercise 7.3.35) and so in this case the area is A - 1 2 l 2  - 1 2 l 2 S 2r l D - rl Therefore we deine the lateral surface area of a cone to be A - rl. l ¨ 2πr l r cut What about more complicated surfaces of revolution? If we follow the strategy we used with arc length, we can approximate the original curve by a polygon. When this polygon is rotated about an axis, it creates a simpler surface whose surface area approxi- mates the actual surface area. By taking a limit, we can determine the exact surface area. The approximating surface, then, consists of a number of bands, each formed by rotating a line segment about an axis. To ind the surface area, each of these bands can be considered a portion of a circular cone, as shown in Figure 3. The area of the band (or frustum of a cone) with slant height l and upper and lower radii r 1 and r 2 is found by subtracting the areas of two cones: A - r 2 sl 1 1 l d 2 r 1 l 1 -  fsr 2 2 r 1 dl 1 1 r 2 l g From similar triangles we have l 1 r 1 - l 1 1 l r 2 which gives r 2 l 1 - r 1 l 1 1 r 1 l or sr 2 2 r 1 dl 1 - r 1 l h r cut h 2πr circumference 2 πr FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 r¡ r™ l¡ l FIGURE 3 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","552 CHAPTER 8 Further Applications of Integration Putting this in Equation 1, we get A -  sr 1 l 1 r 2 l d or A - 2rl where r - 1 2 sr 1 1 r 2 d is the average radius of the band. Now we apply this formula to our strategy. Consider the surface shown in Figure 4, which is obtained by rotating the curve y - f s xd, a < x < b, about the x-axis, where f is positive and has a continuous derivative. In order to deine its surface area, we divide the interval fa, bg into n subintervals with endpoints x 0 , x 1 ,..., x n and equal width Dx, as we did in determining arc length. If y i - f s x i d, then the point P i s x i , y i d lies on the curve. The part of the surface between x i21 and x i is approximated by taking the line segment P i21 P i and rotating it about the x-axis. The result is a band with slant height l - | P i21 P i | and average radius r - 1 2 s y i21 1 y i d so, by Formula 2, its surface area is 2 y i21 1 y i 2 | P i21 P i | As in the proof of Theorem 8.1.2, we have | P i21 P i | - s1 1 f f 9 s x i * dg 2 Dx where x i * is some number in fx i21 , x i g. When Dx is small, we have y i - f s x i d< f s x i * d and also y i21 - f s x i21 d< f s x i * d, since f is continuous. Therefore 2 y i21 1 y i 2 | P i21 P i | < 2 f s x i * d s1 1 f f 9 s x i * dg 2 Dx and so an approximation to what we think of as the area of the complete surface of revo- lution is o n i-1 2 f s x i * d s1 1 f f 9 s x i * dg 2 Dx This approximation appears to become better as n l ` and, recognizing (3) as a Rie- mann sum for the function ts xd - 2 f s xd s1 1 f f 9 s xdg 2 , we have lim n l` o n i-1 2 f s x i * d s1 1 f f 9 s x i * dg 2 Dx - y b a 2 f s xd s1 1 f f 9 s xdg 2 dx Therefore, in the case where f is positive and has a continuous derivative, we deine the surface area of the surface obtained by rotating the curve y - f s xd, a < x < b, about the x-axis as S - y b a 2 f s xd s1 1 f f 9 s xdg 2 dx 2 (b) Approximating band x y y=ƒ (a) Surface of revolution P¸ P i-1 P i P n y i 0 x y a b 0 a b FIGURE 4 3 4 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","558 CHAPTER 8 Further Applications of Integration Among the many applications of integral calculus to physics and engineering, we con- sider two here: force due to water pressure and centers of mass. As with our previous applications to geometry (areas, volumes, and lengths) and to work, our strategy is to break up the physical quantity into a large number of small parts, approximate each small part, add the results (giving a Riemann sum), take the limit, and then evaluate the resulting integral. Hydrostatic Pressure and Force Deep-sea divers realize that water pressure increases as they dive deeper. This is because the weight of the water above them increases. In general, suppose that a thin horizontal plate with area A square meters is sub- merged in a luid of density  kilograms per cubic meter at a depth d meters below the surface of the luid as in Figure 1. The luid directly above the plate (think of a column of liquid) has volume V - Ad, so its mass is m - V - Ad. The force exerted by the luid on the plate is therefore F - mt - t Ad where t is the acceleration due to gravity. The pressure P on the plate is deined to be the force per unit area: P - F A - td The SI unit for measuring pressure is a newton per square meter, which is called a pascal (abbreviation: 1 Nym 2 - 1 Pa). Since this is a small unit, the kilopascal (kPa) is often used. For instance, because the density of water is  - 1000 kgym 3 , the pressure at the bottom of a swimming pool 2 m deep is P - td - 1000 kgy m 3 3 9.8 my s 2 3 2 m - 19,600 Pa - 19.6 kPa An important principle of luid pressure is the experimentally veriied fact that at any point in a liquid the pressure is the same in all directions. (A diver feels the same pres- sure on nose and both ears.) Thus the pressure in any direction at a depth d in a luid with mass density  is given by P - td - d This helps us determine the hydrostatic force (the force exerted by a luid at rest) against a vertical plate or wall or dam. This is not a straightforward problem because the pres- sure is not constant but increases as the depth increases. EXAMPLE 1 A dam has the shape of the trapezoid shown in Figure 2. The height is 20 m and the width is 50 m at the top and 30 m at the bottom. Find the force on the dam due to hydrostatic pressure if the water level is 4 m from the top of the dam. SOLUTION We choose a vertical x-axis with origin at the surface of the water and directed downward as in Figure 3(a). The depth of the water is 16 m, so we divide the surface of fluid d A FIGURE 1 1 50 m 20 m 30 m FIGURE 2 When using US Customary units, we write P - td - d, where  - t is the weight density (as opposed to , which is the mass density). For instance, the weight density of water is  - 62.5 lbyft 3 . Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

As in Example 1 we divide the circular region into horizontal strips of equal width. From the equation of the circle, we see that the length of the i th strip is 2 s9 2 s y i * d 2 and so its area is A i - 2 s9 2 s y i * d 2 Dy Because the weight density of water is  - 62.5 lbyft 3 , the pressure on this strip is approximately  d i - 62.5s7 2 y i * d and so the force on the strip is approximately  d i A i - 62.5s7 2 y i * d 2 s9 2 s y i * d 2 Dy oe„„„„„„„ oe9-(y i * )@ x 0 y 10 7 d i ≈+¥=9 y i * Îy FIGURE 4 (b) a 10 16-x i * 20 (a) x 16 0 _4 15 15 15 a 10 Îx x i * FIGURE 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This point is called the center of mass (or center of gravity) of the plate. We irst consider the simpler situation illustrated in Figure 6, where two masses m 1 and m 2 are attached to a rod of negligible mass on opposite sides of a fulcrum and at distances d 1 and d 2 from the fulcrum. The rod will balance if m 1 d 1 - m 2 d 2 This is an experimental fact discovered by Archimedes and called the Law of the Lever. (Think of a lighter person balancing a heavier one on a seesaw by sitting farther away from the center.) Now suppose that the rod lies along the x-axis with m 1 at x 1 and m 2 at x 2 and the center of mass at x . If we compare Figures 6 and 7, we see that d 1 - x 2 x 1 and d 2 - x 2 2 x and so Equation 2 gives m 1 s x 2 x 1 d - m 2 s x 2 2 x d m 1 x 1 m 2 x - m 1 x 1 1 m 2 x 2 x - m 1 x 1 1 m 2 x 2 m 1 1 m 2 The numbers m 1 x 1 and m 2 x 2 are called the moments of the masses m 1 and m 2 (with respect to the origin), and Equation 3 says that the center of mass x is obtained by adding the moments of the masses and dividing by the total mass m - m 1 1 m 2 . 0 / – x ¤ ¤-x – m¡ m™ x – x-/ In general, if we have a system of n particles with masses m 1 , m 2 , . . . , m n located at the points x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n on the x-axis, it can be shown similarly that the center of mass P FIGURE 5 2 m¡ m™ d¡ fulcrum d™ FIGURE 6 3 FIGURE 7 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Then Equation 4 could be rewrit- ten as mx - M, which says that if the total mass were considered as being concen- trated at the center of mass x , then its moment would be the same as the moment of the system. Now we consider a system of n particles with masses m 1 , m 2 , . . . , m n located at the points s x 1 , y 1 d, s x 2 , y 2 d, . . . , s x n , y n d in the xy-plane as shown in Figure 8. By analogy with the one-dimensional case, we deine the moment of the system about the y-axis to be M y - o n i-1 m i x i and the moment of the system about the x-axis as M x - o n i-1 m i y i Then M y measures the tendency of the system to rotate about the y-axis and M x measures the tendency to rotate about the x-axis. As in the one-dimensional case, the coordinates s x , y d of the center of mass are given in terms of the moments by the formulas x - M y m y - M x m where m - o m i is the total mass. Since mx - M y and my - M x , the center of mass s x , y d is the point where a single particle of mass m would have the same moments as the system. EXAMPLE 3 Find the moments and center of mass of the system of objects that have masses 3, 4, and 8 at the points s21, 1d, s2, 21d, and s3, 2d, respectively.

","562 CHAPTER 8 Further Applications of Integration Next we consider a lat plate (called a lamina) with uniform density  that occupies a region 5 of the plane. We wish to locate the center of mass of the plate, which is called the centroid of 5. In doing so we use the following physical principles: The symmetry principle says that if 5 is symmetric about a line l, then the centroid of 5 lies on l. (If 5 is relected about l, then 5 remains the same so its centroid remains ixed. But the only ixed points lie on l.) Thus the centroid of a rectangle is its center. Moments should be deined so that if the entire mass of a region is concentrated at the center of mass, then its moments remain unchanged. Also, the moment of the union of two nonoverlapping regions should be the sum of the moments of the individual regions. Suppose that the region 5 is of the type shown in Figure 10(a); that is, 5 lies between the lines x - a and x - b, above the x-axis, and beneath the graph of f , where f is a continuous function. We divide the interval fa, bg into n subintervals with endpoints x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x n and equal width Dx. We choose the sample point x i * to be the midpoint x i of the i th subinterval, that is, x i - s x i21 1 x i dy2. This determines the polygonal approxima- tion to 5 shown in Figure 10(b). The centroid of the i th approximating rectangle R i is its center C i (x i , 1 2 f s x i d). Its area is f s x i d Dx, so its mass is  f s x i d Dx The moment of R i about the y-axis is the product of its mass and the distance from C i to the y-axis, which is x i . Thus M y sR i d - f  f s x i d Dxg x i -  x i f s x i d Dx Adding these moments, we obtain the moment of the polygonal approximation to 5, and then by taking the limit as n l ` we obtain the moment of 5 itself about the y-axis: M y - lim nl` o n i-1 x i f s x i d Dx -  y b a xf s xd dx In a similar fashion we compute the moment of R i about the x-axis as the product of its mass and the distance from C i to the x-axis (which is half the height of R i ): M x sR i d - f  f s x i d Dxg 1 2 f s x i d -  ? 1 2 f f s x i dg 2 Dx Again we add these moments and take the limit to obtain the moment of 5 about the x-axis: M x - lim nl` o n i-1  ? 1 2 f f s x i dg 2 Dx -  y b a 1 2 f f s xdg 2 dx Just as for systems of particles, the center of mass of the plate is deined so that mx - M y and my - M x .

","SECTION 8.3 Applications to Physics and Engineering 565 We end this section by showing a surprising connection between centroids and vol- umes of revolution. Theorem of Pappus Let 5 be a plane region that lies entirely on one side of a line l in the plane. If 5 is rotated about l, then the volume of the resulting solid is the product of the area A of 5 and the distance d traveled by the centroid of 5. PROOF We give the proof for the special case in which the region lies between y - f s xd and y - ts xd as in Figure 13 and the line l is the y-axis.

","568 CHAPTER 8 Further Applications of Integration DISCOVERY PROJECT Suppose you have a choice of two coffee cups of the type shown, one that bends outward and one inward, and you notice that they have the same height and their shapes it together snugly. You wonder which cup holds more coffee. Of course you could ill one cup with water and pour it into the other one but, being a calculus student, you decide on a more mathematical approach. Ignoring the handles, you observe that both cups are surfaces of revolution, so you can think of the coffee as a volume of revolution. Cup A Cup B x y 0 h k x=k A¡ x=f(y) A™ 1. Suppose the cups have height h, cup A is formed by rotating the curve x - f s yd about the y-axis, and cup B is formed by rotating the same curve about the line x - k. Find the value of k such that the two cups hold the same amount of coffee. 2. What does your result from Problem 1 say about the areas A1 and A2 shown in the igure? 3. Use Pappus’s Theorem to explain your result in Problems 1 and 2. 4. Based on your own measurements and observations, suggest a value for h and an equation for x - f s yd and calculate the amount of coffee that each cup holds. COMPLEMENTARY COFFEE CUPS 46. The solid obtained by rotating the triangle with vertices s2, 3d, s2, 5d, and s5, 4d about the x-axis 47. The centroid of a curve can be found by a process similar to the one we used for inding the centroid of a region. If C is a curve with length L, then the centroid is s x , y d where x - s1yLd y x ds and y - s1yLd y y ds. Here we assign appro- priate limits of integration, and ds is as deined in Sections 8.1 and 8.2. (The centroid often doesn’t lie on the curve itself. If the curve were made of wire and placed on a weightless board, the centroid would be the balance point on the board.) Find the centroid of the quarter-circle y - s16 2 x 2 , 0 < x < 4. 48. The Second Theorem of Pappus is in the same spirit as Pappus’s Theorem on page 565, but for surface area rather than volume: Let C be a curve that lies entirely on one side of a line l in the plane. If C is rotated about l, then the area of the resulting surface is the product of the arc length of C and the distance traveled by the centroid of C (see Exercise 47). (a) Prove the Second Theorem of Pappus for the case where C is given by y - f s xd, f s xd > 0, and C is rotated about the x-axis. (b) Use the Second Theorem of Pappus to compute the surface area of the half-sphere obtained by rotating the curve from Exercise 47 about the x-axis. Does your answer agree with the one given by geometric formulas? 49. Use the Second Theorem of Pappus described in Exercise 48 to ind the surface area of the torus in Example 7. 50.

","SECTION 8.4 Applications to Economics and Biology 569 In this section we consider some applications of integration to economics (consumer surplus) and biology (blood low, cardiac output). Others are described in the exercises. Consumer Surplus Recall from Section 4.7 that the demand function ps xd is the price that a company has to charge in order to sell x units of a commodity. Usually, selling larger quantities requires lowering prices, so the demand function is a decreasing function. The graph of a typical demand function, called a demand curve, is shown in Figure 1. If X is the amount of the commodity that can currently be sold, then P - psX d is the current selling price. At a given price, some consumers who buy a good would be willing to pay more; they beneit by not having to. The difference between what a consumer is willing to pay and what the consumer actually pays for a good is called the consumer surplus. By inding the total consumer surplus among all purchasers of a good, economists can assess the overall beneit of a market to society. To determine the total consumer surplus, we look at the demand curve and divide the interval f0, X g into n subintervals, each of length Dx - Xyn, and let x i * - x i be the right endpoint of the ith subinterval, as in Figure 2. According to the demand curve, x i21 units would be purchased at a price of ps x i21 d dollars per unit. To increase sales to x i units, the price would have to be lowered to ps x i d dollars. In this case, an additional Dx units would be sold (but no more). In general, the consumers who would have paid ps x i d dol- lars placed a high value on the product; they would have paid what it was worth to them. So in paying only P dollars they have saved an amount of ssavings per unitdsnumber of unitsd - f ps x i d 2 Pg Dx Considering similar groups of willing consumers for each of the subintervals and adding the savings, we get the total savings: o n i-1 f ps x i d 2 Pg Dx (This sum corresponds to the area enclosed by the rectangles in Figure 2.) If we let n l `, this Riemann sum approaches the integral y X 0 f ps xd 2 Pg dx which economists call the consumer surplus for the commodity. The consumer surplus represents the amount of money saved by consumers in pur- chasing the commodity at price P , corresponding to an amount demanded of X. Figure 3 shows the interpretation of the consumer surplus as the area under the demand curve and above the line p - P. EXAMPLE 1 The demand for a product, in dollars, is p - 1200 2 0.2x 2 0.0001x 2 Find the consumer surplus when the sales level is 500.

Now, in order to compute the rate of blood low, or lux (volume per unit time), we consider smaller, equally spaced radii r 1 , r 2 , . . . . The approximate area of the ring (or washer) with inner radius r i21 and outer radius r i is 2r i Dr where Dr - r i 2 r i21 (See Figure 4.) If Dr is small, then the velocity is almost constant throughout this ring and can be approximated by vsr i d. Thus the volume of blood per unit time that lows across the ring is approximately s2r i Drd vsr i d - 2r i vsr i d Dr and the total volume of blood that lows across a cross-section per unit time is about o n i-1 2r i vsr i d Dr This approximation is illustrated in Figure 5. Notice that the velocity (and hence the volume per unit time) increases toward the center of the blood vessel. The approximation gets better as n increases. When we take the limit we get the exact value of the lux (or discharge), which is the volume of blood that passes a cross-section per unit time: F - lim nl` o n i-1 2r i vsr i d Dr - y R 0 2r vsrd dr - y R 0 2r P 4l sR 2 2 r 2 d dr - P 2l y R 0 sR 2 r 2 r 3 d dr - P 2l F R 2 r 2 2 2 r 4 4 G r-0 r-R - P 2l F R 4 2 2 R 4 4 G - PR 4 8l Îr r i FIGURE 4 FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 8.4 Applications to Economics and Biology 571 The resulting equation F -  PR 4 8l is called Poiseuille’s Law; it shows that the lux is proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the blood vessel. Cardiac Output Figure 6 shows the human cardiovascular system. Blood returns from the body through the veins, enters the right atrium of the heart, and is pumped to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries for oxygenation. It then lows back into the left atrium through the pulmonary veins and then out to the rest of the body through the aorta. The cardiac output of the heart is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit time, that is, the rate of low into the aorta. The dye dilution method is used to measure the cardiac output. Dye is injected into the right atrium and lows through the heart into the aorta. A probe inserted into the aorta mea- sures the concentration of the dye leaving the heart at equally spaced times over a time interval f0, T g until the dye has cleared. Let cstd be the concentration of the dye at time t . If we divide f0, T g into subintervals of equal length Dt, then the amount of dye that lows past the measuring point during the subinterval from t - t i21 to t - t i is approximately sconcentrationdsvolumed - cst i dsF Dtd where F is the rate of low that we are trying to determine. Thus the total amount of dye is approximately o n i-1 cst i dF Dt - F o n i-1 cst i d Dt and, letting n l `, we ind that the amount of dye is A - F y T 0 cstd dt Thus the cardiac output is given by F - A y T 0 cstd dt where the amount of dye A is known and the integral can be approximated from the concentration readings. EXAMPLE 2 A 5-mg bolus of dye is injected into a right atrium. The concentration of the dye (in milligrams per liter) is measured in the aorta at one-second intervals as shown in the table. Estimate the cardiac output. SOLUTION Here A - 5, Dt - 1, and T - 10.

The marginal cost function C9 s xd was deined to be the deriva- tive of the cost function. (See Sections 3.7 and 4.7.) The mar- ginal cost of producing x gallons of orange juice is C9 s xd - 0.82 2 0.00003x 1 0.000000003x 2 (measured in dollars per gallon). The ixed start-up cost is Cs0d - $18,000.

Assuming the estimate is accurate, ind the increase in revenue if sales increase from 5000 units to 10,000 units. 3. A mining company estimates that the marginal cost of extract- ing x tons of copper ore from a mine is 0.6 1 0.008x, mea- sured in thousands of dollars per ton. Start-up costs are $100,000. What is the cost of extracting the irst 50 tons of copper? What about the next 50 tons? 4. The demand function for a particular vacation package is ps xd - 2000 2 46 sx . Find the consumer surplus when the sales level for the packages is 400. Illustrate by drawing the demand curve and identifying the consumer surplus as an area. 5. A demand curve is given by p - 450 ys x 1 8d. Find the con- sumer surplus when the selling price is $10. 6. The supply function pSs xd for a commodity gives the relation between the selling price and the number of units that manufac- turers will produce at that price. For a higher price, manufac- turers will produce more units, so pS is an increasing function of x. Let X be the amount of the commodity currently produced and let P - pSsX d be the current price. Some producers would be willing to make and sell the commodity for a lower selling price and are therefore receiving more than their minimal price. The excess is called the producer surplus. An argument simi- lar to that for consumer surplus shows that the surplus is given by the integral y X 0 fP 2 pSs xdg dx Calculate the producer surplus for the supply function pSs xd - 3 1 0.01x 2 at the sales level X - 10. Illustrate by drawing the supply curve and identifying the producer surplus as an area. 7. If a supply curve is modeled by the equation p - 125 1 0.002 x 2 , ind the producer surplus when the selling price is $625. 8. In a purely competitive market, the price of a good is naturally driven to the value where the quantity demanded by consumers matches the quantity made by producers, and the market is said to be in equilibrium. These values are the coordinates of the point of intersection of the supply and demand curves. (a) Given the demand curve p - 50 2 1 20 x and the supply curve p - 20 1 1 10 x for a good, at what quantity and price is the market for the good in equilibrium? (b) Find the consumer surplus and the producer surplus when the market is in equilibrium. Illustrate by sketch- ing the supply and demand curves and identifying the surpluses as areas. 9. The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is called the total surplus; it is one measure economists use as an indicator of the economic health of a society. Total surplus is maximized when the market for a good is in equilibrium. (a) The demand function for an electronics company’s car stereos is ps xd - 228.4 2 18x and the supply function is pS s xd - 27x 1 57.4, where x is measured in thousands. At what quantity is the market for the stereos in equilibrium? (b) Compute the maximum total surplus for the stereos. 10. A camera company estimates that the demand function for its new digital camera is ps xd - 312e 20.14x and the supply function is estimated to be pSs xd - 26e 0.2x , where x is mea- sured in thousands. Compute the maximum total surplus. 11. A company modeled the demand curve for its product (in dollars) by the equation p - 800,000e 2xy5000 x 1 20,000 Use a graph to estimate the sales level when the selling price is $16. Then ind (approximately) the consumer sur- plus for this sales level. 12. A movie theater has been charging $10.00 per person and selling about 500 tickets on a typical weeknight.

High blood pressure results from constriction of the arteries. To maintain a normal low rate (lux), the heart has to pump harder, thus increasing the blood pressure. Use Poiseuille’s Law to show that if R0 and P0 are normal values of the radius and pressure in an artery and the constricted values are R and P , then for the lux to remain constant, P and R are related by the equation P P0 - S R0 R D 4 Deduce that if the radius of an artery is reduced to three-fourths of its former value, then the pressure is more than tripled. 21.

Suppose we consider the cholesterol level of a person chosen at random from a certain age group, or the height of an adult female chosen at random, or the lifetime of a randomly chosen battery of a certain type. Such quantities are called continuous random variables because their values actually range over an interval of real numbers, although they might be measured or recorded only to the nearest integer. We might want to know the probability that a blood cholesterol level is greater than 250, or the probability that the height of an adult Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","574 CHAPTER 8 Further Applications of Integration female is between 60 and 70 inches, or the probability that the battery we are buying lasts between 100 and 200 hours. If X represents the lifetime of that type of battery, we denote this last probability as follows: Ps100 < X < 200d According to the frequency interpretation of probability, this number is the long-run proportion of all batteries of the speciied type whose lifetimes are between 100 and 200 hours. Since it represents a proportion, the probability naturally falls between 0 and 1. Every continuous random variable X has a probability density function f. This means that the probability that X lies between a and b is found by integrating f from a to b: Psa < X < bd - y b a f s xd dx For example, Figure 1 shows the graph of a model for the probability density func- tion f for a random variable X deined to be the height in inches of an adult female in the United States (according to data from the National Health Survey). The probability that the height of a woman chosen at random from this population is between 60 and 70 inches is equal to the area under the graph of f from 60 to 70. x y 0 65 60 70 y=ƒ area= probability that the height of a woman is between 60 and 70 inches In general, the probability density function f of a random variable X satisies the con- dition f s xd > 0 for all x. Because probabilities are measured on a scale from 0 to 1, it follows that y ` 2` f s xd dx - 1 EXAMPLE 1 Let f s xd - 0.006x s10 2 xd for 0 < x < 10 and f s xd - 0 for all other values of x.

Find the exact form of such a function. SOLUTION Think of the random variable as being the time you wait on hold before an agent of a company you’re telephoning answers your call. So instead of x, let’s use t to represent time, in minutes. If f is the probability density function and you call at time t - 0, then, from Deinition 1, y 2 0 f s t d dt represents the probability that an agent answers within the irst two minutes and y 5 4 f s t d dt is the probability that your call is answered during the ifth minute. It’s clear that f s t d - 0 for t , 0 (the agent can’t answer before you place the call). For t . 0 we are told to use an exponentially decreasing function, that is, a function of the form f s t d - Ae 2ct , where A and c are positive constants. Thus f std - H 0 Ae 2ct if t , 0 if t > 0 We use Equation 2 to determine the value of A: 1 - y ` 2` f s t d dt - y 0 2` f s t d dt 1 y ` 0 f s t d dt - y ` 0 Ae 2ct dt - lim x l` y x 0 Ae 2ct dt - lim x l ` F 2 A c e 2ct G 0 x - lim x l ` A c s1 2 e 2cx d - A c Therefore Ay c - 1 and so A - c. Thus every exponential density function has the form f std - H 0 ce 2ct if t , 0 if t > 0 A typical graph is shown in Figure 2. ■ Average Values Suppose you’re waiting for a company to answer your phone call and you wonder how long, on average, you can expect to wait. Let f std be the corresponding density function, where t is measured in minutes, and think of a sample of N people who have called this company. Most likely, none of them had to wait more than an hour, so let’s restrict our attention to the interval 0 < t < 60. Let’s divide that interval into n intervals of length FIGURE 2 An exponential density function 0 f(t)= 0 ce _ct if t<0 if t˘0 t y c Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","576 CHAPTER 8 Further Applications of Integration Dt and endpoints 0, t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t n - 60. (Think of Dt as lasting a minute, or half a minute, or 10 seconds, or even a second.) The probability that somebody’s call gets answered during the time period from t i21 to t i is the area under the curve y - f s t d from t i21 to t i , which is approximately equal to f s t i d Dt. (This is the area of the approximating rectangle in Figure 3, where t i is the midpoint of the interval.) Since the long-run proportion of calls that get answered in the time period from t i21 to t i is f s t i d Dt, we expect that, out of our sample of N callers, the number whose call was answered in that time period is approximately N f s t i d Dt and the time that each waited is about t i . Therefore the total time they waited is the product of these numbers: approximately t i fN f s t i d Dtg. Adding over all such intervals, we get the approximate total of everybody’s waiting times: o n i-1 Nt i f s t i d Dt If we now divide by the number of callers N , we get the approximate average waiting time: o n i-1 t i f s t i d Dt We recognize this as a Riemann sum for the function t f std. As the time interval shrinks (that is, Dt l 0 and n l `), this Riemann sum approaches the integral y 60 0 t f std dt This integral is called the mean waiting time. In general, the mean of any probability density function f is deined to be  - y ` 2` x f s xd dx The mean can be interpreted as the long-run average value of the random variable X. It can also be interpreted as a measure of centrality of the probability density function. The expression for the mean resembles an integral we have seen before. If 5 is the region that lies under the graph of f , we know from Formula 8.3.8 that the x-coordinate of the centroid of 5 is x - y ` 2` x f s xd dx y ` 2` f s xd dx - y ` 2` x f s xd dx -  because of Equation 2. So a thin plate in the shape of 5 balances at a point on the vertical line x - . (See Figure 4.)

(b) Find the probability that a customer waits more than ive minutes to be answered.

","578 CHAPTER 8 Further Applications of Integration Notice the result of Example 4(b): Even though the mean waiting time is 5 minutes, only 37% of callers wait more than 5 minutes. The reason is that some callers have to wait much longer (maybe 10 or 15 minutes), and this brings up the average. Another measure of centrality of a probability density function is the median. That is a number m such that half the callers have a waiting time less than m and the other call- ers have a waiting time longer than m. In general, the median of a probability density function is the number m such that y ` m f s xd dx - 1 2 This means that half the area under the graph of f lies to the right of m. In Exercise 9 you are asked to show that the median waiting time for the company described in Example 4 is approximately 3.5 minutes. Normal Distributions Many important random phenomena—such as test scores on aptitude tests, heights and weights of individuals from a homogeneous population, annual rainfall in a given loca- tion—are modeled by a normal distribution. This means that the probability density function of the random variable X is a member of the family of functions f s xd - 1  s2 e 2s x2d 2 ys2 2 d You can verify that the mean for this function is . The positive constant  is called the standard deviation; it measures how spread out the values of X are. From the bell- shaped graphs of members of the family in Figure 5, we see that for small values of  the values of X are clustered about the mean, whereas for larger values of  the values of X are more spread out. Statisticians have methods for using sets of data to estimate  and . x y 0 m 1 2 s=2 s=1 s= The factor 1 ys s2 d is needed to make f a probability density function.

Doing so, we ind that Ps85 < X < 115d< 0.68 So about 68% of the population has an IQ score between 85 and 115, that is, within one standard deviation of the mean.

In a famous 18th-century problem, known as Buffon’s needle problem, a needle of length h is dropped onto a lat surface (for example, a table) on which parallel lines L units apart, L > h, have been drawn. The problem is to determine the probability that the needle will come to rest intersecting one of the lines. Assume that the lines run east-west, parallel to the x-axis in a rectangular coordinate system (as in the igure). Let y be the distance from the “southern” end of the needle to the nearest line to the north. (If the needle’s southern end lies on a line, let y - 0. If the needle happens to lie east-west, let the “western” end be the “southern” end.) Let  be the angle that the needle makes with a ray extending eastward from the “southern” end. Then 0 < y < L and 0 <  < . Note that the needle intersects one of the lines only when y , h sin . The total set of possibilities for the needle can be identiied with the rectangular region 0 < y < L, 0 <  < , and the proportion of times that the needle intersects a line is the ratio area under y - h sin  area of rectangle This ratio is the probability that the needle intersects a line.

Differential Equations PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT of all the applications of calculus is to differential equations. When physical scientists or social scientists use calculus, more often than not it is to analyze a differential equation that has arisen in the process of modeling some phenomenon that they are studying. Although it is often impossible to ind an explicit formula for the solution of a differen- tial equation, we will see that graphical and numerical approaches provide the needed information. 9 © Dennis Donohue / Shutterstock.com Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","586 CHAPTER 9 Diferential Equations In describing the process of modeling in Section 1.2, we talked about formulating a mathematical model of a real-world problem either through intuitive reasoning about the phenomenon or from a physical law based on evidence from experiments. The math- ematical model often takes the form of a differential equation, that is, an equation that contains an unknown function and some of its derivatives. This is not surprising because in a real-world problem we often notice that changes occur and we want to predict future behavior on the basis of how current values change. Let’s begin by examining several examples of how differential equations arise when we model physical phenomena. Models for Population Growth One model for the growth of a population is based on the assumption that the population grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population. That is a reasonable assumption for a population of bacteria or animals under ideal conditions (unlimited environment, adequate nutrition, absence of predators, immunity from disease). Let’s identify and name the variables in this model: t - time sthe independent variabled P - the number of individuals in the population sthe dependent variabled The rate of growth of the population is the derivative dP ydt. So our assumption that the rate of growth of the population is proportional to the population size is written as the equation dP dt - kP where k is the proportionality constant. Equation 1 is our irst model for population growth; it is a differential equation because it contains an unknown function P and its derivative dP ydt. Having formulated a model, let’s look at its consequences. If we rule out a population of 0, then Ps t d . 0 for all t. So, if k . 0, then Equation 1 shows that P9 s t d . 0 for all t. This means that the population is always increasing. In fact, as Ps t d increases, Equa- tion 1 shows that dP ydt becomes larger. In other words, the growth rate increases as the population increases. Let’s try to think of a solution of Equation 1. This equation asks us to ind a function whose derivative is a constant multiple of itself. We know from Chapter 3 that exponen- tial functions have that property. In fact, if we let Ps t d - Ce kt , then P9 s t d - Cske kt d - ksCe kt d - kPs t d Thus any exponential function of the form Ps t d - Ce kt is a solution of Equation 1. In Section 9.4, we will see that there is no other solution. Allowing C to vary through all the real numbers, we get the family of solutions Ps t d - Ce kt whose graphs are shown in Figure 1. But populations have only positive values and so we are interested only in the solutions with C . 0. And we are probably Now is a good time to read (or reread) the discussion of mathematical model- ing on page 23. 1 FIGURE 1 The family of solutions of dPydt - kP t P Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 9.1 Modeling with Diferential Equations 587 concerned only with values of t greater than the initial time t - 0. Figure 2 shows the physically meaningful solutions. Putting t - 0, we get Ps0d - Ce ks0d - C, so the con- stant C turns out to be the initial population, Ps0d. Equation 1 is appropriate for modeling population growth under ideal conditions, but we have to recognize that a more realistic model must relect the fact that a given envi- ronment has limited resources. Many populations start by increasing in an exponential manner, but the population levels off when it approaches its carrying capacity M (or decreases toward M if it ever exceeds M). For a model to take into account both trends, we make two assumptions: ■ dP dt < kP if P is small (Initially, the growth rate is proportional to P .) ■ dP dt , 0 if P . M (P decreases if it ever exceeds M.) A simple expression that incorporates both assumptions is given by the equation dP dt - kP S 1 2 P M D Notice that if P is small compared with M, then P yM is close to 0 and so dP ydt < kP. If P . M, then 1 2 P yM is negative and so dP ydt , 0. Equation 2 is called the logistic differential equation and was proposed by the Dutch mathematical biologist Pierre-François Verhulst in the 1840s as a model for world population growth. We will develop techniques that enable us to ind explicit solutions of the logistic equation in Section 9.4, but for now we can deduce qualitative character- istics of the solutions directly from Equation 2. We irst observe that the constant func- tions Ps t d - 0 and Ps t d - M are solutions because, in either case, one of the factors on the right side of Equation 2 is zero. (This certainly makes physical sense: If the popula- tion is ever either 0 or at the carrying capacity, it stays that way.) These two constant solutions are called equilibrium solutions. If the initial population Ps0d lies between 0 and M, then the right side of Equation 2 is positive, so dP ydt . 0 and the population increases. But if the population exceeds the carrying capacity sP . M d, then 1 2 P yM is negative, so dP ydt , 0 and the population decreases. Notice that, in either case, if the population approaches the carrying capacity sP l M d, then dP ydt l 0, which means the population levels off. So we expect that the solutions of the logistic differential equation have graphs that look something like the ones in Figure 3. Notice that the graphs move away from the equilibrium solution P - 0 and move toward the equilibrium solution P - M. A Model for the Motion of a Spring Let’s now look at an example of a model from the physical sciences. We consider the motion of an object with mass m at the end of a vertical spring (as in Figure 4). In Section 6.4 we discussed Hooke’s Law, which says that if the spring is stretched (or compressed) x units from its natural length, then it exerts a force that is proportional to x: restoring force - 2kx where k is a positive constant (called the spring constant). If we ignore any exter- nal resisting forces (due to air resistance or friction) then, by Newton’s Second Law 0 t P FIGURE 2 The family of solutions Ps t d - Ce kt with C . 0 and t > 0 2 FIGURE 3 Solutions of the logistic equation t P 0 P=M P =0 equilibrium solutions m x 0 x m equilibrium position FIGURE 4 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","588 CHAPTER 9 Diferential Equations (force equals mass times acceleration), we have m d 2 x dt 2 - 2kx This is an example of what is called a second-order differential equation because it involves second derivatives. Let’s see what we can guess about the form of the solution directly from the equation. We can rewrite Equation 3 in the form d 2 x dt 2 - 2 k m x which says that the second derivative of x is proportional to x but has the opposite sign. We know two functions with this property, the sine and cosine functions. In fact, it turns out that all solutions of Equation 3 can be written as combinations of certain sine and cosine functions (see Exercise 4). This is not surprising; we expect the spring to oscillate about its equilibrium position and so it is natural to think that trigonometric functions are involved. General Diferential Equations In general, a differential equation is an equation that contains an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that occurs in the equation. Thus Equations 1 and 2 are irst-order equations and Equation 3 is a second-order equation. In all three of those equations the independent variable is called t and represents time, but in general the independent variable doesn’t have to represent time. For example, when we consider the differential equation y9 - xy it is understood that y is an unknown function of x. A function f is called a solution of a differential equation if the equation is satisied when y - f s xd and its derivatives are substituted into the equation. Thus f is a solution of Equation 4 if f 9 s xd - xf s xd for all values of x in some interval. When we are asked to solve a differential equation we are expected to ind all possible solutions of the equation. We have already solved some particularly simple differential equations, namely, those of the form y9 - f s xd For instance, we know that the general solution of the differential equation y9 - x 3 is given by y - x 4 4 1 C where C is an arbitrary constant. But, in general, solving a differential equation is not an easy matter. There is no sys- tematic technique that enables us to solve all differential equations.

","SECTION 9.1 Modeling with Diferential Equations 589 ever, we will see how to draw rough graphs of solutions even when we have no explicit formula. We will also learn how to ind numerical approximations to solutions. EXAMPLE 1 Show that every member of the family of functions y - 1 1 ce t 1 2 ce t is a solution of the differential equation y9 - 1 2 s y 2 2 1d.

In many physical problems we need to ind the particular solution that satisies a condition of the form y st 0 d - y 0 . This is called an initial condi- tion, and the problem of inding a solution of the differential equation that satisies the initial condition is called an initial-value problem. Geometrically, when we impose an initial condition, we look at the family of solution curves and pick the one that passes through the point st 0 , y 0 d. Physically, this corresponds to measuring the state of a system at time t 0 and using the solution of the initial-value problem to predict the future behavior of the system. EXAMPLE 2 Find a solution of the differential equation y9 - 1 2 s y 2 2 1d that satisies the initial condition y s0d - 2.

","592 CHAPTER 9 Diferential Equations Direction Fields Suppose we are asked to sketch the graph of the solution of the initial-value problem y9 - x 1 y y s0d - 1 We don’t know a formula for the solution, so how can we possibly sketch its graph? Let’s think about what the differential equation means. The equation y9 - x 1 y tells us that the slope at any point s x, yd on the graph (called the solution curve) is equal to the sum of the x- and y-coordinates of the point (see Figure 1). In particular, because the curve passes through the point s0, 1d, its slope there must be 0 1 1 - 1. So a small portion of the solution curve near the point s0, 1d looks like a short line segment through s0, 1d with slope 1. (See Figure 2.) As a guide to sketching the rest of the curve, let’s draw short line segments at a num- ber of points s x, yd with slope x 1 y. The result is called a direction ield and is shown in Figure 3. For instance, the line segment at the point s1, 2d has slope 1 1 2 - 3. The direction ield allows us to visualize the general shape of the solution curves by indi- cating the direction in which the curves proceed at each point. 0 x 2 1 y 0 x 2 1 y (0, 1) FIGURE 3 Direction ield for y9 - x 1 y FIGURE 4 The solution curve through (0,1) TEC Module 9.2A shows direction ields and solution curves for a variety of differential equations. Now we can sketch the solution curve through the point s0, 1d by following the direc- tion ield as in Figure 4. Notice that we have drawn the curve so that it is parallel to nearby line segments. In general, suppose we have a irst-order differential equation of the form y9 - Fs x, yd where Fs x, yd is some expression in x and y. The differential equation says that the slope of a solution curve at a point s x, yd on the curve is Fs x, yd. If we draw short line segments with slope Fs x, yd at several points s x, yd, the result is called a direction ield (or slope ield). These line segments indicate the direction in which a solution curve is heading, so the direction ield helps us visualize the general shape of these curves. EXAMPLE 1 (a) Sketch the direction ield for the differential equation y9 - x 2 1 y 2 2 1. (b) Use part (a) to sketch the solution curve that passes through the origin.

","SECTION 9.2 Direction Fields and Euler’s Method 593 SOLUTION (a) We start by computing the slope at several points in the following chart: x 22 21 0 1 2 22 21 0 1 2 . . . y 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 . . . y9 - x 2 1 y 2 2 1 3 0 21 0 3 4 1 0 1 4 . . . Now we draw short line segments with these slopes at these points. The result is the direction ield shown in Figure 5. (b) We start at the origin and move to the right in the direction of the line segment (which has slope 21). We continue to draw the solution curve so that it moves parallel to the nearby line segments. The resulting solution curve is shown in Figure 6. Return- ing to the origin, we draw the solution curve to the left as well. ■ The more line segments we draw in a direction ield, the clearer the picture becomes. Of course, it’s tedious to compute slopes and draw line segments for a huge number of points by hand, but computers are well suited for this task. Figure 7 shows a more detailed, computer-drawn direction ield for the differential equation in Example 1. It enables us to draw, with reasonable accuracy, the solution curves with y-intercepts 22, 21, 0, 1, and 2. Now let’s see how direction ields give insight into physical situations. The simple electric circuit shown in Figure 8 contains an electromotive force (usually a battery or generator) that produces a voltage of Es t d volts ( V ) and a current of I s t d amperes (A) at time t. The circuit also contains a resistor with a resistance of R ohms (V) and an induc- tor with an inductance of L henries (H). Ohm’s Law gives the drop in voltage due to the resistor as RI. The voltage drop due to the inductor is LsdI ydtd. One of Kirchhoff’s laws says that the sum of the voltage drops is equal to the supplied voltage Es t d. Thus we have L dI dt 1 RI - Es t d which is a irst-order differential equation that models the current I at time t. EXAMPLE 2 Suppose that in the simple circuit of Figure 8 the resistance is 12 V, the inductance is 4 H, and a battery gives a constant voltage of 60 V. (a) Draw a direction ield for Equation 1 with these values. (b) What can you say about the limiting value of the current? (c) Identify any equilibrium solutions. (d) If the switch is closed when t - 0 so the current starts with Is0d - 0, use the direc- tion ield to sketch the solution curve. SOLUTION (a) If we put L - 4, R - 12, and Es t d - 60 in Equation 1, we get 4 dI dt 1 12I - 60 or dI dt - 15 2 3I 0 x y 1 _1 _2 1 2 -1 _2 2 FIGURE 5 1 3 _3 _3 3 FIGURE 7 0 x y 1 2 _1 _2 1 2 -1 _2 FIGURE 6 R E switch L FIGURE 8 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","594 CHAPTER 9 Diferential Equations The direction ield for this differential equation is shown in Figure 9. 0 t 1 I 2 3 2 4 6 (b) It appears from the direction ield that all solutions approach the value 5 A, that is, lim t l ` Is t d - 5 (c) It appears that the constant function Is t d - 5 is an equilibrium solution. Indeed, we can verify this directly from the differential equation dI ydt - 15 2 3I . If Is t d - 5, then the left side is dI ydt - 0 and the right side is 15 2 3s5d - 0. (d) We use the direction ield to sketch the solution curve that passes through s0, 0d, as shown in red in Figure 10. 0 t 1 I 2 3 2 4 6 ■ Notice from Figure 9 that the line segments along any horizontal line are parallel. That is because the independent variable t does not occur on the right side of the equation I 9 - 15 2 3I . In general, a differential equation of the form y9 - f s yd in which the independent variable is missing from the right side, is called autonomous. For such an equation, the slopes corresponding to two different points with the same y-coordinate must be equal. This means that if we know one solution to an autonomous differential equation, then we can obtain ininitely many others just by shifting the graph of the known solution to the right or left. In Figure 10 we have shown the solutions that result from shifting the solution curve of Example 2 one and two time units (namely, seconds) to the right. They correspond to closing the switch when t - 1 or t - 2. FIGURE 9 FIGURE 10 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

","SECTION 9.2 Direction Fields and Euler’s Method 595 Euler’s Method The basic idea behind direction ields can be used to ind numerical approximations to solutions of differential equations. We illustrate the method on the initial-value problem that we used to introduce direction ields: y9 - x 1 y y s0d - 1 The differential equation tells us that y9 s0d - 0 1 1 - 1, so the solution curve has slope 1 at the point s0, 1d. As a irst approximation to the solution we could use the linear approx- imation Ls xd - x 1 1. In other words, we could use the tangent line at s0, 1d as a rough approximation to the solution curve (see Figure 11). Euler’s idea was to improve on this approximation by proceeding only a short distance along this tangent line and then making a midcourse correction by changing direction as indicated by the direction ield. Figure 12 shows what happens if we start out along the tangent line but stop when x - 0.5. (This horizontal distance traveled is called the step size.) Since Ls0.5d - 1.5, we have ys0.5d< 1.5 and we take s0.5, 1.5d as the starting point for a new line segment. The differential equation tells us that y9 s0.5d - 0.5 1 1.5 - 2, so we use the linear function y - 1.5 1 2s x 2 0.5d - 2x 1 0.5 as an approximation to the solution for x . 0.5 (the green segment in Figure 12). If we decrease the step size from 0.5 to 0.25, we get the better Euler approximation shown in Figure 13. In general, Euler’s method says to start at the point given by the initial value and pro- ceed in the direction indicated by the direction ield. Stop after a short time, look at the slope at the new location, and proceed in that direction. Keep stopping and changing direction according to the direction ield. Euler’s method does not produce the exact solution to an initial-value problem—it gives approximations. But by decreasing the step size (and therefore increasing the number of midcourse corrections), we obtain succes- sively better approximations to the exact solution. (Compare Figures 11, 12, and 13.) For the general irst-order initial-value problem y9 - Fs x, yd, y s x 0 d - y 0 , our aim is to ind approximate values for the solution at equally spaced numbers x 0 , x 1 - x 0 1 h, x 2 - x 1 1 h, . . . , where h is the step size. The differential equation tells us that the slope at s x 0 , y 0 d is y9 - Fs x 0 , y 0 d, so Figure 14 shows that the approximate value of the solu- tion when x - x 1 is y 1 - y 0 1 hFs x 0 , y 0 d Similarly, y 2 - y 1 1 hFs x 1 , y 1 d In general, y n - y n21 1 hFs x n21 , y n21 d Euler’s Method Approximate values for the solution of the initial-value problem y9 - Fs x, yd, ys x 0 d - y 0 , with step size h, at x n - x n21 1 h, are y n - y n21 1 hFs x n21 , y n21 d n - 1, 2, 3, . . . y x 0 1 1 y=L(x) solution curve FIGURE 11 First Euler approximation y x 0 1 1 0.5 1.5 FIGURE 12 Euler approximation with step size 0.5 y x 0 1 1 0.25 FIGURE 13 Euler approximation with step size 0.25 y x / x¸ 0 y¸ h hF(x¸, y¸) (/, ›) slope=F(x¸, y¸) FIGURE 14 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","596 CHAPTER 9 Diferential Equations EXAMPLE 3 Use Euler’s method with step size 0.1 to construct a table of approximate values for the solution of the initial-value problem y9 - x 1 y y s0d - 1 SOLUTION We are given that h - 0.1, x 0 - 0, y 0 - 1, and Fs x, yd - x 1 y. So we have y 1 - y 0 1 hFs x 0 , y 0 d - 1 1 0.1s0 1 1d - 1.1 y 2 - y 1 1 hFs x 1 , y 1 d - 1.1 1 0.1s0.1 1 1.1d - 1.22 y 3 - y 2 1 hFs x 2 , y 2 d - 1.22 1 0.1s0.2 1 1.22d - 1.362 This means that if y s xd is the exact solution, then y s0.3d< 1.362.

But for a large number of small steps the amount of computation is considerable and so we need to program a calculator or computer to carry out these calculations. The follow- ing table shows the results of applying Euler’s method with decreasing step size to the initial-value problem of Example 3. Notice that the Euler estimates in the table below seem to be approaching limits, namely, the true values of y s0.5d and y s1d.

He was born in Switzerland but spent most of his career at the academies of science supported by Catherine the Great in St. Petersburg and Frederick the Great in Berlin. The collected works of Euler (pronounced Oiler) ill about 100 large volumes. As the French physicist Arago said, “Euler calculated without apparent efort, as men breathe or as eagles sustain them- selves in the air.” Euler’s calculations and writings were not diminished by raising 13 children or being totally blind for the last 17 years of his life. In fact, when blind, he dictated his discoveries to his helpers from his prodigious memory and imagination. His treatises on cal- culus and most other mathematical subjects became the standard for math- ematics instruction and the equation e i 1 1 - 0 that he discovered brings together the ive most famous numbers in all of mathematics. EXAMPLE 4 In Example 2 we discussed a simple electric circuit with resistance 12 V, inductance 4 H, and a battery with voltage 60 V. If the switch is closed when t - 0, we modeled the current I at time t by the initial-value problem dI dt - 15 2 3I I s0d - 0 Estimate the current in the circuit half a second after the switch is closed.

The igure shows a circuit containing an electromotive force, a capacitor with a capacitance of C farads (F), and ; CAS We have looked at irst-order differential equations from a geometric point of view (direction ields) and from a numerical point of view (Euler’s method). What about the symbolic point of view? It would be nice to have an explicit formula for a solution of a differential equation. Unfortunately, that is not always possible. But in this section we examine a certain type of differential equation that can be solved explicitly. A separable equation is a irst-order differential equation in which the expression for dy ydx can be factored as a function of x times a function of y. In other words, it can be written in the form dy dx - ts xd f s yd The name separable comes from the fact that the expression on the right side can be “sep- Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

To solve this equation we rewrite it in the differential form hs yd dy - ts xd dx so that all y’s are on one side of the equation and all x’s are on the other side. Then we integrate both sides of the equation: y hs yd dy - y ts xd dx Equation 2 deines y implicitly as a function of x. In some cases we may be able to solve for y in terms of x. We use the Chain Rule to justify this procedure: If h and t satisfy (2), then d dx Sy hs yd dy D - d dx Sy ts xd dx D so d dy Sy hs yd dy D dy dx - ts xd and hs yd dy dx - t s xd Thus Equation 1 is satisied. EXAMPLE 1 (a) Solve the differential equation dy dx - x 2 y 2 . (b) Find the solution of this equation that satisies the initial condition y s0d - 2.

(We could have used a constant C 1 on the left side and another constant C 2 on the right side. But then we could combine these constants by writing C - C 2 2 C 1 .) Solving for y, we get y - s 3 x 3 1 3C We could leave the solution like this or we could write it in the form y - s 3 x 3 1 K where K - 3C. (Since C is an arbitrary constant, so is K.) 1 Figure 1 shows graphs of several mem- bers of the family of solutions of the differential equation in Example 1.

","SECTION 9.3 Separable Equations 601 (b) If we put x - 0 in the general solution in part (a), we get y s 0d - s 3 K . To satisfy the initial condition y s0d - 2, we must have s 3 K - 2 and so K - 8. Thus the solution of the initial-value problem is y - s 3 x 3 1 8 ■ EXAMPLE 2 Solve the differential equation dy dx - 6x 2 2y 1 cos y .

Equation 3 gives the general solution implicitly. In this case it’s impossible to solve the equation to express y explicitly as a function of x. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Solve the equation y9 - x 2 y. SOLUTION First we rewrite the equation using Leibniz notation: dy dx - x 2 y If y ± 0, we can rewrite it in differential notation and integrate: dy y - x 2 dx y ± 0 y dy y - y x 2 dx ln | y | - x 3 3 1 C This equation deines y implicitly as a function of x. But in this case we can solve explicitly for y as follows: | y | - e ln | y | - e s x 3 y3d1C - e C e x 3 y3 so y - 6e C e x 3 y3 We can easily verify that the function y - 0 is also a solution of the given differential equation. So we can write the general solution in the form y - Ae x 3 y3 where A is an arbitrary constant ( A - e C , or A - 2e C , or A - 0). ■ Some computer software can plot curves deined by implicit equations.

What is the limiting value of the current? SOLUTION With L - 4, R - 12, and Es t d - 60, the equation becomes 4 dI dt 1 12I - 60 or dI dt - 15 2 3I and the initial-value problem is dI dt - 15 2 3I Is0d - 0 We recognize this equation as being separable, and we solve it as follows: y dI 15 2 3I - y dt s15 2 3I ± 0d 2 1 3 ln | 15 2 3I | - t 1 C | 15 2 3I | - e 23st1Cd 15 2 3I - 6e 23C e 23 t - Ae 23 t I - 5 2 1 3 Ae 23 t Since Is0d - 0, we have 5 2 1 3 A - 0, so A - 15 and the solution is Is t d - 5 2 5e 23 t The limiting current, in amperes, is lim t l` Is t d - lim t l` s5 2 5e 23 t d - 5 2 5 lim t l` e 23 t - 5 2 0 - 5 ■ R E switch L FIGURE 5 Figure 6 shows how the solution in Example 4 (the current) approaches its limiting value.

","SECTION 9.3 Separable Equations 603 Orthogonal Trajectories An orthogonal trajectory of a family of curves is a curve that intersects each curve of the family orthogonally, that is, at right angles (see Figure 7). For instance, each mem- ber of the family y - mx of straight lines through the origin is an orthogonal trajectory of the family x 2 1 y 2 - r 2 of concentric circles with center the origin (see Figure 8). We say that the two families are orthogonal trajectories of each other. EXAMPLE 5 Find the orthogonal trajectories of the family of curves x - ky 2 , where k is an arbitrary constant. SOLUTION The curves x - ky 2 form a family of parabolas whose axis of symmetry is the x-axis. The irst step is to ind a single differential equation that is satisied by all members of the family. If we differentiate x - ky 2 , we get 1 - 2ky dy dx or dy dx - 1 2ky This differential equation depends on k, but we need an equation that is valid for all values of k simultaneously. To eliminate k we note that, from the equation of the given general parabola x - ky 2 , we have k - xy y 2 and so the differential equation can be written as dy dx - 1 2ky - 1 2 x y 2 y or dy dx - y 2x This means that the slope of the tangent line at any point s x, yd on one of the parabolas is y9 - yys2xd. On an orthogonal trajectory the slope of the tangent line must be the negative reciprocal of this slope. Therefore the orthogonal trajectories must satisfy the differential equation dy dx - 2 2x y This differential equation is separable, and we solve it as follows: y y dy - 2 y 2x dx y 2 2 - 2x 2 1 C x 2 1 y 2 2 - C where C is an arbitrary positive constant. Thus the orthogonal trajectories are the family of ellipses given by Equation 4 and sketched in Figure 9. ■ Orthogonal trajectories occur in various branches of physics. For example, in an elec- trostatic ield the lines of force are orthogonal to the lines of constant potential. Also, the streamlines in aerodynamics are orthogonal trajectories of the velocity-equipotential curves. orthogonal trajectory FIGURE 7 x y FIGURE 8 4 x y FIGURE 9 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","604 CHAPTER 9 Diferential Equations Mixing Problems A typical mixing problem involves a tank of ixed capacity illed with a thoroughly mixed solution of some substance, such as salt. A solution of a given concentration enters the tank at a ixed rate and the mixture, thoroughly stirred, leaves at a ixed rate, which may differ from the entering rate. If y s t d denotes the amount of substance in the tank at time t, then y9 s t d is the rate at which the substance is being added minus the rate at which it is being removed. The mathematical description of this situation often leads to a irst- order separable differential equation. We can use the same type of reasoning to model a variety of phenomena: chemical reactions, discharge of pollutants into a lake, injection of a drug into the bloodstream. EXAMPLE 6 A tank contains 20 kg of salt dissolved in 5000 L of water. Brine that contains 0.03 kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of 25 Lymin. The solution is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate. How much salt remains in the tank after half an hour? SOLUTION Let y s t d be the amount of salt (in kilograms) after t minutes. We are given that y s0d - 20 and we want to ind y s30d. We do this by inding a differential equation satisied by y s t d. Note that dyy dt is the rate of change of the amount of salt, so dy dt - srate ind 2 srate outd where (rate in) is the rate at which salt enters the tank and (rate out) is the rate at which salt leaves the tank. We have rate in - S 0.03 kg L DS 25 L min D - 0.75 kg min The tank always contains 5000 L of liquid, so the concentration at time t is y s t dy5000 (measured in kilograms per liter). Since the brine lows out at a rate of 25 Lymin, we have rate out - S y s t d 5000 kg L DS 25 L min D - y s t d 200 kg min Thus, from Equation 5, we get dy dt - 0.75 2 y s t d 200 - 150 2 y s t d 200 Solving this separable differential equation, we obtain y dy 150 2 y - y dt 200 2ln | 150 2 y | - t 200 1 C Since y s0d - 20, we have 2ln 130 - C, so 2ln | 150 2 y | - t 200 2 ln 130 5 Figure 10 shows the graph of the function y s t d of Example 6.

For example, think of a boat moving through the water. (a) Suppose that the resisting force is proportional to the velocity, that is, f svd - 2k v, k a positive constant. (This model is appropriate for small values of v.) Let vs0d - v0 and ss0d - s0 be the initial values of v and s. Determine v and s at any time t. What is the total distance that the object travels from time t - 0? (b) For larger values of v a better model is obtained by sup- posing that the resisting force is proportional to the square of the velocity, that is, f svd - 2k v 2 , k . 0. (This model was irst proposed by Newton.) Let v0 and s0 be the initial values of v and s. Determine v and s at any time t. What is the total distance that the object travels in this case? 51. Allometric growth in biology refers to relationships between sizes of parts of an organism (skull length and body length, for instance). If L1s t d and L2s t d are the sizes of two organs in an organism of age t, then L1 and L2 satisfy an allometric law if Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","608 CHAPTER 9 Diferential Equations APPLIED PROJECT If water (or other liquid) drains from a tank, we expect that the low will be greatest at irst (when the water depth is greatest) and will gradually decrease as the water level decreases. But we need a more precise mathematical description of how the low decreases in order to answer the kinds of questions that engineers ask: How long does it take for a tank to drain completely? How much water should a tank hold in order to guarantee a certain minimum water pressure for a sprinkler system? Let hs t d and Vs t d be the height and volume of water in a tank at time t. If water drains through a hole with area a at the bottom of the tank, then Torricelli’s Law says that dV dt - 2a s2t h where t is the acceleration due to gravity. So the rate at which water lows from the tank is pro- portional to the square root of the water height. 1. (a) Suppose the tank is cylindrical with height 6 ft and radius 2 ft and the hole is circular with radius 1 inch. If we take t - 32 ft y s 2 , show that h satisies the differential equation dh dt - 2 1 72 sh (b) Solve this equation to ind the height of the water at time t, assuming the tank is full at time t - 0. (c) How long will it take for the water to drain completely? 2. Because of the rotation and viscosity of the liquid, the theoretical model given by Equation 1 isn’t quite accurate. Instead, the model dh dt - k sh is often used and the constant k (which depends on the physical properties of the liquid) is determined from data concerning the draining of the tank. (a) Suppose that a hole is drilled in the side of a cylindrical bottle and the height h of the water (above the hole) decreases from 10 cm to 3 cm in 68 seconds. Use Equation 2 to ind an expression for hs t d. Evaluate hs t d for t - 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. (b) Drill a 4-mm hole near the bottom of the cylindrical part of a two-liter plastic soft-drink bottle. Attach a strip of masking tape marked in centimeters from 0 to 10, with corre- sponding to the top of the hole. With one inger over the hole, ill the bottle with water to the 10-cm mark. Then take your inger off the hole and record the values of hs t d for t - 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 seconds. (You will probably ind that it takes 68 seconds for the level to decrease to h - 3 cm.) Compare your data with the values of hs t d from part (a). How well did the model predict the actual values? 3. In many parts of the world, the water for sprinkler systems in large hotels and hospitals is supplied by gravity from cylindrical tanks on or near the roofs of the buildings. Suppose such a tank has radius 10 ft and the diameter of the outlet is 2.5 inches. An engineer has to guaran- 1 2 © Richard Le Borne, Dept.

(When a ire happens, the electrical system might fail and it could take up to 10 minutes for the emergency generator and ire pump to be activated.) What height should the engineer specify for the tank in order to make such a guarantee? (Use the fact that the water pressure at a depth of d feet is P - 62.5d. See Section 8.3.) 4. Not all water tanks are shaped like cylinders. Suppose a tank has cross-sectional area Ashd at height h.

APPLIED PROJECT Suppose you throw a ball into the air. Do you think it takes longer to reach its maximum height or to fall back to earth from its maximum height? We will solve the problem in this project, but before getting started, think about that situation and make a guess based on your physical intuition. 1. A ball with mass m is projected vertically upward from the earth’s surface with a positive initial velocity v0. We assume the forces acting on the ball are the force of gravity and a retarding force of air resistance with direction opposite to the direction of motion and with magnitude p | vstd | , where p is a positive constant and vstd is the velocity of the ball at time t. In both the ascent and the descent, the total force acting on the ball is 2pv 2 mt . [During ascent, vstd is positive and the resistance acts downward; during descent, vstd is negative and the resistance acts upward.] So, by Newton’s Second Law, the equation of motion is mv9 - 2pv 2 mt Solve this differential equation to show that the velocity is v std - S v0 1 mt p D e 2ptym 2 mt p 2. Show that the height of the ball, until it hits the ground, is ys t d - S v0 1 mt p D m p s1 2 e 2ptym d 2 mt t p WHICH IS FASTER, GOING UP OR COMING DOWN? In modeling force due to air resis- tance, various functions have been used, depending on the physical characteristics and speed of the ball. Here we use a linear model, 2pv, but a quadratic model (2pv 2 on the way up and pv 2 on the way down) is another possibility for higher speeds (see Exercise 9.3.50). For a golf ball, experiments have shown that a good model is 2pv 1.3 going up and p | v | 1.3 coming down. But no matter which force function 2f svd is used [where f svd . 0 for v . 0 and f svd , 0 for v , 0], the answer to the question remains the same. See F. Brauer, “What Goes Up Must Come Down, Eventually,” American Mathematical Monthly 108 (2001), pp. 437–440. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Let t 1 be the time that the ball takes to reach its maximum height. Show that t 1 - m p ln S mt 1 pv0 mt D Find this time for a ball with mass 1 kg and initial velocity 20 mys. Assume the air resistance is 1 10 of the speed. 4. Let t2 be the time at which the ball falls back to earth. For the particular ball in Problem 3, estimate t2 by using a graph of the height function y s t d. Which is faster, going up or coming down? 5. In general, it’s not easy to ind t2 because it’s impossible to solve the equation y s t d - 0 explicitly. We can, however, use an indirect method to determine whether ascent or descent is faster: we determine whether y s2t1d is positive or negative. Show that y s2t1d - m 2 t p 2 S x 2 1 x 2 2 ln x D where x - e pt 1 ym . Then show that x . 1 and the function f s xd - x 2 1 x 2 2 ln x is increasing for x . 1. Use this result to decide whether y s2t1d is positive or negative. What can you conclude? Is ascent or descent faster? ; In this section we investigate differential equations that are used to model population growth: the law of natural growth, the logistic equation, and several others. The Law of Natural Growth One of the models for population growth that we considered in Section 9.1 was based on the assumption that the population grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population: dP dt - kP Is that a reasonable assumption? Suppose we have a population (of bacteria, for instance) with size P - 1000 and at a certain time it is growing at a rate of P9 - 300 bacteria per hour. Now let’s take another 1000 bacteria of the same type and put them with the irst population. Each half of the combined population was previously growing at a rate of 300 bacteria per hour. We would expect the total population of 2000 to increase at a rate of 600 bacteria per hour initially (provided there’s enough room and nutrition). So if we double the size, we double the growth rate. It seems reasonable that the growth rate should be proportional to the size. In general, if Ps t d is the value of a quantity y at time t and if the rate of change of P with respect to t is proportional to its size Ps t d at any time, then dP dt - kP 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Equation 1 is sometimes called the law of natural growth. If k is positive, then the population increases; if k is negative, it decreases. Because Equation 1 is a separable differential equation, we can solve it by the meth- ods of Section 9.3: y dP P - y k dt ln | P | - kt 1 C | P | - e kt1C - e C e kt P - Ae kt where A (- 6e C or 0) is an arbitrary constant. To see the signiicance of the constant A, we observe that Ps0d - Ae k ? 0 - A Therefore A is the initial value of the function. 2 The solution of the initial-value problem dP dt - kP Ps0d - P 0 is Ps t d - P 0 e kt Examples and exercises on the use of (2) are given in Section 3.8. Another way of writing Equation 1 is 1 P dP dt - k which says that the relative growth rate (the growth rate divided by the population size) is constant. Then (2) says that a population with constant relative growth rate must grow exponentially. We can account for emigration (or “harvesting”) from a population by modifying Equation 1: if the rate of emigration is a constant m, then the rate of change of the popu- lation is modeled by the differential equation dP dt - kP 2 m See Exercise 17 for the solution and consequences of Equation 3. The Logistic Model As we discussed in Section 9.1, a population often increases exponentially in its early stages but levels off eventually and approaches its carrying capacity because of limited resources. If Pstd is the size of the population at time t, we assume that dP dt < kP if P is small 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","612 CHAPTER 9 Diferential Equations This says that the growth rate is initially close to being proportional to size. In other words, the relative growth rate is almost constant when the population is small. But we also want to relect the fact that the relative growth rate decreases as the popula- tion P increases and becomes negative if P ever exceeds its carrying capacity M, the maximum population that the environment is capable of sustaining in the long run. The simplest expression for the relative growth rate that incorporates these assumptions is 1 P dP dt - k S 1 2 P M D Multiplying by P, we obtain the model for population growth known as the logistic dif- ferential equation: dP dt - kP S 1 2 P M D Notice from Equation 4 that if P is small compared with M, then P yM is close to 0 and so dP ydt < kP. However, if P l M (the population approaches its carrying capacity), then P yM l 1, so dP ydt l 0. We can deduce information about whether solutions increase or decrease directly from Equation 4. If the population P lies between 0 and M, then the right side of the equation is positive, so dP ydt . 0 and the population increases. But if the population exceeds the carrying capacity sP . M d, then 1 2 P yM is negative, so dP ydt , 0 and the population decreases. Let’s start our more detailed analysis of the logistic differential equation by looking at a direction ield. EXAMPLE 1 Draw a direction ield for the logistic equation with k - 0.08 and carry- ing capacity M - 1000. What can you deduce about the solutions? SOLUTION In this case the logistic differential equation is dP dt - 0.08P S 1 2 P 1000 D A direction ield for this equation is shown in Figure 1.

","SECTION 9.4 Models for Population Growth 613 The logistic equation is autonomous (dP ydt depends only on P, not on t), so the slopes are the same along any horizontal line. As expected, the slopes are positive for 0 , P , 1000 and negative for P . 1000. The slopes are small when P is close to 0 or 1000 (the carrying capacity). Notice that the solutions move away from the equilibrium solution P - 0 and move toward the equilibrium solution P - 1000. In Figure 2 we use the direction ield to sketch solution curves with initial popula- tions Ps0d - 100, Ps0d - 400, and Ps0d - 1300. Notice that solution curves that start below P - 1000 are increasing and those that start above P - 1000 are decreasing. The slopes are greatest when P < 500 and therefore the solution curves that start below P - 1000 have inlection points when P < 500. In fact we can prove that all solution curves that start below P - 500 have an inlection point when P is exactly 500.

Let Ps t d be the performance level of someone learning a skill as a function of the training time t. The graph of P is called a learning curve. In Exercise 9.1.15 we proposed the differential equation dP dt - k fM 2 Ps t dg as a reasonable model for learning, where k is a positive con- stant. Solve it as a linear differential equation and use your solution to graph the learning curve. 32. Two new workers were hired for an assembly line. Jim pro- cessed 25 units during the first hour and 45 units during the second hour. Mark processed 35 units during the first hour and 50 units the second hour. Using the model of Exercise 31 and assuming that Ps0d - 0, estimate the maximum number of units per hour that each worker is capable of processing. 33. In Section 9.3 we looked at mixing problems in which the volume of luid remained constant and saw that such problems give rise to separable differentiable equations. (See Example 6 in that section.) If the rates of low into and out of the system are different, then the volume is not constant and the resulting differential equation is linear but not separable. A tank contains 100 L of water. A solution with a salt con- centration of 0.4 kgyL is added at a rate of 5 Lymin. The solution is kept mixed and is drained from the tank at a rate of 3 Ly min. If y s t d is the amount of salt (in kilograms) after t minutes, show that y satisies the differential equation dy dt - 2 2 3y 100 1 2t Solve this equation and ind the concentration after 20 minutes.

","SECTION 9.6 Predator-Prey Systems 627 We have looked at a variety of models for the growth of a single species that lives alone in an environment. In this section we consider more realistic models that take into account the interaction of two species in the same habitat. We will see that these models take the form of a pair of linked differential equations. We irst consider the situation in which one species, called the prey, has an ample food supply and the second species, called the predators, feeds on the prey. Examples of prey and predators include rabbits and wolves in an isolated forest, food-ish and sharks, aphids and ladybugs, and bacteria and amoebas. Our model will have two dependent variables and both are functions of time. We let Rstd be the number of prey (using R for rabbits) and Wstd be the number of predators (with W for wolves) at time t. In the absence of predators, the ample food supply would support exponential growth of the prey, that is, dR dt - kR where k is a positive constant In the absence of prey, we assume that the predator population would decline through mortality at a rate proportional to itself, that is, dW dt - 2rW where r is a positive constant With both species present, however, we assume that the principal cause of death among the prey is being eaten by a predator, and the birth and survival rates of the predators depend on their available food supply, namely, the prey. We also assume that the two species encounter each other at a rate that is proportional to both populations and is therefore proportional to the product RW. (The more there are of either population, the more encounters there are likely to be.) A system of two differential equations that incor- porates these assumptions is as follows: dR dt - kR 2 aRW dW dt - 2rW 1 bRW where k, r, a, and b are positive constants. Notice that the term 2aRW decreases the natural growth rate of the prey and the term bRW increases the natural growth rate of the predators. The equations in (1) are known as the predator-prey equations, or the Lotka-Volterra equations. A solution of this system of equations is a pair of functions Rstd and Wstd that describe the populations of prey and predators as functions of time. Because the system is coupled (R and W occur in both equations), we can’t solve one equation and then the other; we have to solve them simultaneously. Unfortunately, it is usually impossible to ind explicit formulas for R and W as functions of t. We can, however, use graphical methods to analyze the equations. 1 W represents the predators. R represents the prey. is constant, then Ps t d - M 1 1 CMe 2 y k std dt Deduce that if y ` 0 k s t d dt - `, then limt l` Ps t d - M. [This will be true if k s t d - k 0 1 a cos bt with k 0 . 0, which describes a positive intrinsic growth rate with a periodic seasonal variation.] (c) If k is constant but M varies, show that z s t d - e 2kt y t 0 ke ks Mssd ds 1 Ce 2kt and use l’Hospital’s Rule to deduce that if Ms t d has a limit as t l `, then Ps t d has the same limit. The Lotka-Volterra equations were proposed as a model to explain the variations in the shark and food-ish populations in the Adriatic Sea by the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra (1860–1940).

","628 CHAPTER 9 Diferential Equations EXAMPLE 1 Suppose that populations of rabbits and wolves are described by the Lotka-Volterra equations (1) with k - 0.08, a - 0.001, r - 0.02, and b - 0.00002. The time t is measured in months. (a) Find the constant solutions (called the equilibrium solutions) and interpret the answer. (b) Use the system of differential equations to ind an expression for dW ydR. (c) Draw a direction ield for the resulting differential equation in the RW-plane. Then use that direction ield to sketch some solution curves. (d) Suppose that, at some point in time, there are 1000 rabbits and 40 wolves. Draw the corresponding solution curve and use it to describe the changes in both population levels. (e) Use part (d) to make sketches of R and W as functions of t. SOLUTION (a) With the given values of k, a, r, and b, the Lotka-Volterra equations become dR dt - 0.08R 2 0.001RW dW dt - 20.02W 1 0.00002RW Both R and W will be constant if both derivatives are 0, that is, R9 - Rs0.08 2 0.001W d - 0 W9 - Ws20.02 1 0.00002Rd - 0 One solution is given by R - 0 and W - 0. (This makes sense: If there are no rabbits or wolves, the populations are certainly not going to increase.) The other constant solution is W - 0.08 0.001 - 80 R - 0.02 0.00002 - 1000 So the equilibrium populations consist of 80 wolves and 1000 rabbits. This means that 1000 rabbits are just enough to support a constant wolf population of 80. There are nei- ther too many wolves (which would result in fewer rabbits) nor too few wolves (which would result in more rabbits).

Notice that the curves appear to be closed in the sense that if we travel along a curve, we always return to the same point. Notice also that the point (1000, 80) is inside all the solution curves.

Starting at the point P 0 at time t - 0 and letting t increase, do we move clockwise or counterclockwise around the phase trajectory? If we put R - 1000 and W - 40 in the irst differential equation, we get dR dt - 0.08s1000d 2 0.001s1000ds40d - 80 2 40 - 40 Since dRy dt . 0, we conclude that R is increasing at P 0 and so we move counter- clockwise around the phase trajectory. We see that at P 0 there aren’t enough wolves to maintain a balance between the populations, so the rabbit population increases. That results in more wolves and eventu- ally there are so many wolves that the rabbits have a hard time avoiding them. So the number of rabbits begins to decline (at P 1 , where we estimate that R reaches its maxi- mum population of about 2800). This means that at some later time the wolf population starts to fall (at P 2 , where R - 1000 and W < 140). But this beneits the rabbits, so their population later starts to increase (at P 3 , where W - 80 and R < 210). As a con- sequence, the wolf population eventually starts to increase as well. This happens when the populations return to their initial values of R - 1000 and W - 40, and the entire cycle begins again. (e) From the description in part (d) of how the rabbit and wolf populations rise and fall, we can sketch the graphs of Rs t d and Ws t d. Suppose the points P 1 , P 2 , and P 3 in Figure 3 are reached at times t 1 , t 2 , and t 3 . Then we can sketch graphs of R and W as in Figure 4. 0 t R 2500 t¡ t£ t™ 2000 1500 1000 500 0 t W 140 t¡ t£ 120 100 80 60 40 20 t™ FIGURE 4 Graphs of the rabbit and wolf populations as functions of time To make the graphs easier to compare, we draw the graphs on the same axes but with different scales for R and W, as in Figure 5 on page 631. Notice that the rabbits reach their maximum populations about a quarter of a cycle before the wolves. ■ An important part of the modeling process, as we discussed in Section 1.2, is to inter- pret our mathematical conclusions as real-world predictions and to test the predictions against real data. The Hudson’s Bay Company, which started trading in animal furs in Canada in 1670, has kept records that date back to the 1840s. Figure 6 shows graphs of the number of pelts of the snowshoe hare and its predator, the Canada lynx, traded by the company over a 90-year period. You can see that the coupled oscillations in the hare and lynx populations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra model do actually occur and the period of these cycles is roughly 10 years.

One way to modify the Lotka-Volterra equations is to assume that, in the absence of predators, the prey grow according to a logistic model with carrying capacity M.

In this chapter we discuss two new methods for describing curves. Some curves, such as the cycloid, are best handled when both x and y are given in terms of a third variable t called a parameter fx - f s t d, y - ts t dg. Other curves, such as the cardioid, have their most convenient description when we use a new coordinate system, called the polar coordi- nate system. 10 Stocktrek / Stockbyte / Getty Images Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","640 CHAPTER 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates Imagine that a particle moves along the curve C shown in Figure 1. It is impossible to describe C by an equation of the form y - f s xd because C fails the Vertical Line Test. But the x- and y-coordinates of the particle are functions of time and so we can write x - f std and y - tstd. Such a pair of equations is often a convenient way of describing a curve and gives rise to the following deinition. Suppose that x and y are both given as functions of a third variable t (called a param- eter) by the equations x - f s t d y - ts t d (called parametric equations). Each value of t determines a point s x, yd, which we can plot in a coordinate plane. As t varies, the point s x, yd - s f s t d, ts t dd varies and traces out a curve C, which we call a parametric curve. The parameter t does not necessarily rep- resent time and, in fact, we could use a letter other than t for the parameter. But in many applications of parametric curves, t does denote time and therefore we can interpret s x, yd - s f s t d, ts t dd as the position of a particle at time t. EXAMPLE 1 Sketch and identify the curve deined by the parametric equations x - t 2 2 2t y - t 1 1 SOLUTION Each value of t gives a point on the curve, as shown in the table. For instance, if t - 0, then x - 0, y - 1 and so the corresponding point is s0, 1d. In Fig- ure 2 we plot the points s x, yd determined by several values of the parameter and we join them to produce a curve. t x y 22 8 21 21 3 0 0 0 1 1 21 2 2 0 3 3 3 4 4 8 5 0 t=0 t=1 t=2 t=3 t=4 t=_1 t=_2 (0, 1) y x 8 FIGURE 2 A particle whose position is given by the parametric equations moves along the curve in the direction of the arrows as t increases. Notice that the consecutive points marked on the curve appear at equal time intervals but not at equal distances. That is because the particle slows down and then speeds up as t increases. It appears from Figure 2 that the curve traced out by the particle may be a parabola. This can be conirmed by eliminating the parameter t as follows. We obtain t - y 2 1 from the second equation and substitute into the irst equation. This gives x - t 2 2 2t - s y 2 1d 2 2 2s y 2 1d - y 2 2 4y 1 3 and so the curve represented by the given parametric equations is the parabola x - y 2 2 4y 1 3. ■ FIGURE 1 C 0 (x, y)={ f(t), g(t)} y x This equation in x and y describes where the particle has been, but it doesn’t tell us when the particle was at a particular point. The parametric equations have an advantage––they tell us when the particle was at a point. They also indicate the direction of the motion. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 10.1 Curves Deined by Parametric Equations 641 No restriction was placed on the parameter t in Example 1, so we assumed that t could be any real number. But sometimes we restrict t to lie in a inite interval. For instance, the parametric curve x - t 2 2 2t y - t 1 1 0 < t < 4 shown in Figure 3 is the part of the parabola in Example 1 that starts at the point s0, 1d and ends at the point s8, 5d. The arrowhead indicates the direction in which the curve is traced as t increases from 0 to 4. In general, the curve with parametric equations x - f s t d y - ts t d a < t < b has initial point s f sad, tsadd and terminal point s f sbd, tsbdd. EXAMPLE 2 What curve is represented by the following parametric equations? x - cos t y - sin t 0 < t < 2 SOLUTION If we plot points, it appears that the curve is a circle. We can conirm this impression by eliminating t. Observe that x 2 1 y 2 - cos 2 t 1 sin 2 t - 1 Thus the point s x, yd moves on the unit circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1. Notice that in this example the parameter t can be interpreted as the angle (in radians) shown in Figure 4. As t increases from 0 to 2, the point s x, yd - scos t, sin td moves once around the circle in the counterclockwise direction starting from the point s1, 0d. ■ EXAMPLE 3 What curve is represented by the given parametric equations? x - sin 2t y - cos 2t 0 < t < 2 SOLUTION Again we have x 2 1 y 2 - sin 2 2t 1 cos 2 2t - 1 so the parametric equations again represent the unit circle x 2 1 y 2 - 1. But as t increases from 0 to 2, the point s x, yd - ssin 2t, cos 2td starts at s0, 1d and moves twice around the circle in the clockwise direction as indicated in Figure 5. ■ Examples 2 and 3 show that different sets of parametric equations can represent the same curve. Thus we distinguish between a curve, which is a set of points, and a para- metric curve, in which the points are traced in a particular way. EXAMPLE 4 Find parametric equations for the circle with center sh, kd and radius r. SOLUTION If we take the equations of the unit circle in Example 2 and multiply the expressions for x and y by r, we get x - r cos t, y - r sin t. You can verify that these equations represent a circle with radius r and center the origin traced counterclockwise. We now shift h units in the x-direction and k units in the y-direction and obtain para- 0 (8, 5) (0, 1) y x FIGURE 3 3π 2 t= π 2 t= 0 t t=0 (1, 0) (cos t, sin t) t=2π t=π x y FIGURE 4 0 t=0 , π, 2π x y (0, 1) FIGURE 5 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

SOLUTION Observe that y - ssin td 2 - x 2 and so the point s x, yd moves on the parabola y - x 2 . But note also that, since 21 < sin t < 1, we have 21 < x < 1, so the para- metric equations represent only the part of the parabola for which 21 < x < 1. Since sin t is periodic, the point s x, yd - ssin t, sin 2 td moves back and forth ininitely often along the parabola from s21, 1d to s1, 1d.

It would be possible to solve the given equation s x - y 4 2 3y 2 d for y as four functions of x and graph them individually, but the parametric equations provide a much easier method. ■ In general, if we need to graph an equation of the form x - t s yd, we can use the parametric equations x - t s t d y - t Notice also that curves with equations y - f s xd (the ones we are most familiar with— graphs of functions) can also be regarded as curves with parametric equations x - t y - f s t d Graphing devices are particularly useful for sketching complicated parametric curves.

","644 CHAPTER 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates SOLUTION We choose as parameter the angle of rotation  of the circle s - 0 when P is at the origin). Suppose the circle has rotated through  radians. Because the circle has been in contact with the line, we see from Figure 14 that the distance it has rolled from the origin is | OT | - arc PT - r  Therefore the center of the circle is Csr , rd. Let the coordinates of P be s x, yd. Then from Figure 14 we see that x - | OT | 2 | PQ | - r  2 r sin  - r s 2 sin d y - | TC | 2 | QC | - r 2 r cos  - r s1 2 cos d Therefore parametric equations of the cycloid are x - r s 2 sin d y - r s1 2 cos d  [ R One arch of the cycloid comes from one rotation of the circle and so is described by 0 <  < 2. Although Equations 1 were derived from Figure 14, which illustrates the case where 0 ,  , y2, it can be seen that these equations are still valid for other values of  (see Exercise 39). Although it is possible to eliminate the parameter  from Equations 1, the resulting Cartesian equation in x and y is very complicated and not as convenient to work with as the parametric equations. ■ One of the irst people to study the cycloid was Galileo, who proposed that bridges be built in the shape of cycloids and who tried to ind the area under one arch of a cycloid. Later this curve arose in connection with the brachistochrone problem: Find the curve along which a particle will slide in the shortest time (under the inluence of gravity) from a point A to a lower point B not directly beneath A. The Swiss mathematician John Bernoulli, who posed this problem in 1696, showed that among all possible curves that join A to B, as in Figure 15, the particle will take the least time sliding from A to B if the curve is part of an inverted arch of a cycloid. The Dutch physicist Huygens had already shown that the cycloid is also the solution to the tautochrone problem; that is, no matter where a particle P is placed on an inverted cycloid, it takes the same time to slide to the bottom (see Figure 16). Huygens proposed that pendulum clocks (which he invented) should swing in cycloidal arcs because then the pendulum would take the same time to make a complete oscillation whether it swings through a wide or a small arc. Families of Parametric Curves EXAMPLE 8 Investigate the family of curves with parametric equations x - a 1 cos t y - a tan t 1 sin t What do these curves have in common? How does the shape change as a increases? SOLUTION We use a graphing device to produce the graphs for the cases a - 22, 21, 20.5, 20.2, 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 shown in Figure 17. Notice that all of these curves (except the case a - 0) have two branches, and both branches approach the vertical asymptote x - a as x approaches a from the left or right. x O y T C (r¨, r ) r ¨ x y r¨ P Q FIGURE 14 1 A B cycloid FIGURE 15 P P P P P FIGURE 16 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

For a between 21 and 0 the cusp turns into a loop, which becomes larger as a approaches 0. When a - 0, both branches come together and form a circle (see Example 2). For a between 0 and 1, the left branch has a loop, which shrinks to become a cusp when a - 1. For a . 1, the branches become smooth again, and as a increases further, they become less curved. Notice that the curves with a positive are relections about the y-axis of the corresponding curves with a negative.

He called them conchoids because the shape of their outer branches resembles that of a conch shell or mussel shell. ■ FIGURE 17 Members of the family x - a 1 cos t, y - a tan t 1 sin t, all graphed in the viewing rectangle f24, 4g by f24, 4g 9. x - st , y - 1 2 t 10. x - t 2 , y - t 3 11–18 (a) Eliminate the parameter to ind a Cartesian equation of the curve.

If the circle C rolls on the outside of the ixed circle, the curve traced out by P is called an epicycloid. Find parametric equations for the epicycloid. 6. Investigate the possible shapes for epicycloids. Use methods similar to Problems 2–4. Having seen how to represent curves by parametric equations, we now apply the methods of calculus to these parametric curves. In particular, we solve problems involving tan- gents, areas, arc length, and surface area. Tangents Suppose f and t are differentiable functions and we want to ind the tangent line at a point on the parametric curve x - f s t d, y - ts t d, where y is also a differentiable function of x. Then the Chain Rule gives dy dt - dy dx ? dx dt If dxydt ± 0, we can solve for dyydx: dy dx - dy dt dx dt if dx dt ± 0 Equation 1 (which you can remember by thinking of canceling the dt’s) enables us to ind the slope dyydx of the tangent to a parametric curve without having to eliminate the parameter t. We see from (1) that the curve has a horizontal tangent when dyydt - 0 (provided that dxydt ± 0) and it has a vertical tangent when dxydt - 0 (provided that dyydt ± 0). This information is useful for sketching parametric curves. As we know from Chapter 4, it is also useful to consider d 2 yydx 2 . This can be found by replacing y by dyydx in Equation 1: d 2 y dx 2 - d dx S dy dx D - d dt S dy dx D dx dt If we think of the curve as being traced out by a moving particle, then dyydt and dxydt are the vertical and horizontal velocities of the particle and Formula 1 says that the slope of the tangent is the ratio of these velocities. 1 Note that d 2 y dx 2 Þ d 2 y dt 2 d 2 x dt 2 TEC Look at Module 10.1B to see how hypocycloids and epicycloids are formed by the motion of rolling circles.

(a) Show that C has two tangents at the point (3, 0) and ind their equations. (b) Find the points on C where the tangent is horizontal or vertical. (c) Determine where the curve is concave upward or downward. (d) Sketch the curve. SOLUTION (a) Notice that y - t 3 2 3t - t st 2 2 3d - 0 when t - 0 or t - 6s3 . Therefore the point s3, 0d on C arises from two values of the parameter, t - s3 and t - 2s3 . This indicates that C crosses itself at s3, 0d. Since dy dx - dyydt dxydt - 3t 2 2 3 2t - 3 2 S t 2 1 t D the slope of the tangent when t - 6s3 is dyydx - 66ys2 s3 d - 6s3 , so the equa- tions of the tangents at s3, 0d are y - s3 s x 2 3d and y - 2s3 s x 2 3d (b) C has a horizontal tangent when dyydx - 0, that is, when dyydt - 0 and dxydt ± 0. Since dyydt - 3t 2 2 3, this happens when t 2 - 1, that is, t - 61. The corresponding points on C are s1, 22d and (1, 2). C has a vertical tangent when dxydt - 2t - 0, that is, t - 0. (Note that dyydt ± 0 there.) The corresponding point on C is (0, 0).

","658 CHAPTER 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates A coordinate system represents a point in the plane by an ordered pair of numbers called coordinates. Usually we use Cartesian coordinates, which are directed distances from two perpendicular axes. Here we describe a coordinate system introduced by Newton, called the polar coordinate system, which is more convenient for many purposes. We choose a point in the plane that is called the pole (or origin) and is labeled O. Then we draw a ray (half-line) starting at O called the polar axis. This axis is usually drawn horizontally to the right and corresponds to the positive x-axis in Cartesian coordinates. If P is any other point in the plane, let r be the distance from O to P and let  be the angle (usually measured in radians) between the polar axis and the line OP as in Fig- ure 1. Then the point P is represented by the ordered pair sr, d and r,  are called polar coordinates of P. We use the convention that an angle is positive if measured in the counterclockwise direction from the polar axis and negative in the clockwise direction. If P - O, then r - 0 and we agree that s0, d represents the pole for any value of . We extend the meaning of polar coordinates sr, d to the case in which r is negative by agreeing that, as in Figure 2, the points s2r, d and sr, d lie on the same line through O and at the same distance | r | from O, but on opposite sides of O. If r . 0, the point sr, d lies in the same quadrant as ; if r , 0, it lies in the quadrant on the opposite side of the pole. Notice that s2r, d represents the same point as sr,  1 d. EXAMPLE 1 Plot the points whose polar coordinates are given.

Notice that when t - 0 we have s x, yd - s x 0, y0 d and when t - 1 we have s x, yd - s x 3, y 3d, so the curve starts at P0 and ends at P3. 1. Graph the Bézier curve with control points P0s4, 1d, P1s28, 48d, P2s50, 42d, and P3s40, 5d. Then, on the same screen, graph the line segments P0P1, P1P2, and P2P3. (Exercise 10.1.31 shows how to do this.) Notice that the middle control points P1 and P2 don’t lie on the curve; the curve starts at P0, heads toward P1 and P2 without reaching them, and ends at P3. 2. From the graph in Problem 1, it appears that the tangent at P0 passes through P1 and the tangent at P3 passes through P2. Prove it. 3. Try to produce a Bézier curve with a loop by changing the second control point in Problem 1. 4. Some laser printers use Bézier curves to represent letters and other symbols. Experiment with control points until you ind a Bézier curve that gives a reasonable representation of the letter C. 5. More complicated shapes can be represented by piecing together two or more Bézier curves. Suppose the irst Bézier curve has control points P0, P1, P2, P3 and the second one has control points P3, P4, P5, P6. If we want these two pieces to join together smoothly, then the tangents at P3 should match and so the points P2, P3, and P4 all have to lie on this com- mon tangent line. Using this principle, ind control points for a pair of Bézier curves that represent the letter S. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The connection between polar and Cartesian coordinates can be seen from Figure 5, in which the pole corresponds to the origin and the polar axis coincides with the positive x-axis. If the point P has Cartesian coordinates s x, yd and polar coordinates sr, d, then, from the igure, we have cos  - x r sin  - y r and so x - r cos  y - r sin  Although Equations 1 were deduced from Figure 5, which illustrates the case where r . 0 and 0 ,  , y2, these equations are valid for all values of r and . (See the gen- eral deinition of sin  and cos  in Appendix D.) Equations 1 allow us to ind the Cartesian coordinates of a point when the polar coor- dinates are known. To ind r and  when x and y are known, we use the equations O y x ¨ x y r P(r, ¨)=P(x, y) FIGURE 5 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

EXAMPLE 2 Convert the point s2, y3d from polar to Cartesian coordinates. SOLUTION Since r - 2 and  - y3, Equations 1 give x - r cos  - 2 cos  3 - 2 ? 1 2 - 1 y - r sin  - 2 sin  3 - 2 ? s3 2 - s3 Therefore the point is s1, s3 d in Cartesian coordinates. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Represent the point with Cartesian coordinates s1, 21d in terms of polar coordinates. SOLUTION If we choose r to be positive, then Equations 2 give r - sx 2 1 y 2 - s1 2 1 s21d 2 - s2 tan  - y x - 21 Since the point s1, 21d lies in the fourth quadrant, we can choose  - 2y4 or  - 7y4. Thus one possible answer is ss2 , 2y4d; another is ss2 , 7y4d. ■ NOTE Equations 2 do not uniquely determine  when x and y are given because, as  increases through the interval 0 <  , 2, each value of tan  occurs twice. Therefore, in converting from Cartesian to polar coordinates, it’s not good enough just to ind r and  that satisfy Equations 2. As in Example 3, we must choose  so that the point sr, d lies in the correct quadrant. Polar Curves The graph of a polar equation r - f sd, or more generally Fsr, d - 0, consists of all points P that have at least one polar representation sr, d whose coordinates satisfy the equation. EXAMPLE 4 What curve is represented by the polar equation r - 2? SOLUTION The curve consists of all points sr, d with r - 2. Since r represents the distance from the point to the pole, the curve r - 2 represents the circle with center O and radius 2. In general, the equation r - a represents a circle with center O and radius | a | . (See Figure 6.) ■ 2 FIGURE 6 x r= 1 2 r=1 r=2 r=4 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Notice that the points sr, 1d on the line with r . 0 are in the irst quadrant, whereas those with r , 0 are in the third quadrant. ■ EXAMPLE 6 (a) Sketch the curve with polar equation r - 2 cos . (b) Find a Cartesian equation for this curve. SOLUTION (a) In Figure 8 we ind the values of r for some convenient values of  and plot the cor- responding points sr, d. Then we join these points to sketch the curve, which appears to be a circle. We have used only values of  between 0 and , since if we let  increase beyond , we obtain the same points again.

","662 CHAPTER 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates EXAMPLE 7 Sketch the curve r - 1 1 sin . SOLUTION Instead of plotting points as in Example 6, we irst sketch the graph of r - 1 1 sin  in Cartesian coordinates in Figure 10 by shifting the sine curve up one unit. This enables us to read at a glance the values of r that correspond to increasing values of . For instance, we see that as  increases from 0 to y2, r (the distance from O) increases from 1 to 2, so we sketch the corresponding part of the polar curve in Figure 11(a). As  increases from y2 to , Figure 10 shows that r decreases from 2 to 1, so we sketch the next part of the curve as in Figure 11(b). As  increases from  to 3y2, r decreases from 1 to 0 as shown in part (c). Finally, as  increases from 3y2 to 2, r increases from 0 to 1 as shown in part (d). If we let  increase beyond 2 or decrease beyond 0, we would simply retrace our path. Putting together the parts of the curve from Figure 11(a)–(d), we sketch the complete curve in part (e). It is called a cardioid because it’s shaped like a heart.

As  increases from 0 to y4, Figure 12 shows that r decreases from 1 to 0 and so we draw the corresponding portion of the polar curve in Figure 13 (indicated by ). As  increases from y4 to y2, r goes from 0 to 21. This means that the distance from O increases from 0 to 1, but instead of being in the irst quadrant this portion of the polar curve (indicated by ) lies on the opposite side of the pole in the third quadrant. The remainder of the curve is drawn in a similar fashion, with the arrows and numbers indicating the order in which the portions are traced out. The resulting curve has four loops and is called a four-leaved rose. ¨=0 ¨=π ¨= 3π 4 ¨= π 2 ¨= π 4 r 1 ¨ 2π π 5π 4 π 2 π 4 3π 4 3π 2 7π 4 ! @ # ^ & % * $ ! @ # $ % & ^ * FIGURE 12 r - cos 2 in Cartesian coordinates FIGURE 13 Four-leaved rose r - cos 2 ■ 0 r 1 2 ¨ π 2π 3π 2 π 2 FIGURE 10 r - 1 1 sin  in Cartesian coordinates, 0 <  < 2 TEC Module 10.3 helps you see how polar curves are traced out by showing animations similar to Figures 10 –13.

","SECTION 10.3 Polar Coordinates 663 Symmetry When we sketch polar curves it is sometimes helpful to take advantage of symmetry. The following three rules are explained by Figure 14. (a) If a polar equation is unchanged when  is replaced by 2, the curve is symmetric about the polar axis. (b) If the equation is unchanged when r is replaced by 2r, or when  is replaced by  1 , the curve is symmetric about the pole. (This means that the curve remains unchanged if we rotate it through 180° about the origin.) (c) If the equation is unchanged when  is replaced by  2 , the curve is symmetric about the vertical line  - y2. The curves sketched in Examples 6 and 8 are symmetric about the polar axis, since coss2d - cos . The curves in Examples 7 and 8 are symmetric about  - y2 because sins 2 d - sin  and cos 2s 2 d - cos 2. The four-leaved rose is also symmetric about the pole. These symmetry properties could have been used in sketching the curves. For instance, in Example 6 we need only have plotted points for 0 <  < y2 and then relected about the polar axis to obtain the complete circle. Tangents to Polar Curves To ind a tangent line to a polar curve r - f sd, we regard  as a parameter and write its parametric equations as x - r cos  - f sd cos  y - r sin  - f sd sin  Then, using the method for inding slopes of parametric curves (Equation 10.2.1) and the Product Rule, we have dy dx - dy d dx d - dr d sin  1 r cos  dr d cos  2 r sin  We locate horizontal tangents by inding the points where dyyd - 0 (provided that dxyd ± 0). Likewise, we locate vertical tangents at the points where dxyd - 0 (pro- vided that dyyd ± 0). Notice that if we are looking for tangent lines at the pole, then r - 0 and Equation 3 simpliies to dy dx - tan  if dr d ± 0 O (r, ¨ ) (_ r, ¨ ) O (r, ¨ ) (r, _¨) _¨ ¨ (a) (b) (c) O (r, ¨ ) (r, π-¨) π-¨ ¨ FIGURE 14 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","664 CHAPTER 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates For instance, in Example 8 we found that r - cos 2 - 0 when  - y4 or 3y4. This means that the lines  - y4 and  - 3y4 (or y - x and y - 2x) are tangent lines to r - cos 2 at the origin.

When  - 3y2, both dyyd and dx yd are 0, so we must be careful.

","SECTION 10.3 Polar Coordinates 665 NOTE Instead of having to remember Equation 3, we could employ the method used to derive it. For instance, in Example 9 we could have written x - r cos  - s1 1 sin d cos  - cos  1 1 2 sin 2 y - r sin  - s1 1 sin d sin  - sin  1 sin 2  Then we have dy dx - dyyd dxyd - cos  1 2 sin  cos  2sin  1 cos 2 - cos  1 sin 2 2sin  1 cos 2 which is equivalent to our previous expression. Graphing Polar Curves with Graphing Devices Although it’s useful to be able to sketch simple polar curves by hand, we need to use a graphing calculator or computer when we are faced with a curve as complicated as the ones shown in Figures 16 and 17. Some graphing devices have commands that enable us to graph polar curves directly. With other machines we need to convert to parametric equations irst. In this case we take the polar equation r - f sd and write its parametric equations as x - r cos  - f sd cos  y - r sin  - f sd sin  Some machines require that the parameter be called t rather than . EXAMPLE 10 Graph the curve r - sins8y5d. SOLUTION Let’s assume that our graphing device doesn’t have a built-in polar graphing command. In this case we need to work with the corresponding parametric equations, which are x - r cos  - sins8y5d cos  y - r sin  - sins8y5d sin  In any case we need to determine the domain for . So we ask ourselves: How many complete rotations are required until the curve starts to repeat itself? If the answer is n, then sin 8s 1 2nd 5 - sin S 8  5 1 16n 5 D - sin 8  5 and so we require that 16ny5 be an even multiple of . This will irst occur when n - 5. Therefore we will graph the entire curve if we specify that 0 <  < 10. Switching from  to t, we have the equations x - sins8t y5d cos t y - sins8t y5d sin t 0 < t < 10 and Figure 18 shows the resulting curve. Notice that this rose has 16 loops. ■ EXAMPLE 11 Investigate the family of polar curves given by r - 1 1 c sin . How does the shape change as c changes? (These curves are called limaçons, after a French word for snail, because of the shape of the curves for certain values of c.) SOLUTION Figure 19 on page 666 shows computer-drawn graphs for various values of c. For c . 1 there is a loop that decreases in size as c decreases. When c - 1 the loop disappears and the curve becomes the cardioid that we sketched in Example 7. For c between 1 and 1 2 the cardioid’s cusp is smoothed out and becomes a “dimple.” When c 1 _1 _1 1 FIGURE 16 r - sin 3 s2.5d 1 cos 3 s2.5d 3 _3 _3 3 FIGURE 17 r - 2 1 sin 3 s2.4d 1 _1 _1 1 FIGURE 18 r - sins8y5d Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 10.4 Areas and Lengths in Polar Coordinates 669 In this section we develop the formula for the area of a region whose boundary is given by a polar equation. We need to use the formula for the area of a sector of a circle: A - 1 2 r 2  where, as in Figure 1, r is the radius and  is the radian measure of the central angle. Formula 1 follows from the fact that the area of a sector is proportional to its central angle: A - sy2dr 2 - 1 2 r 2  . (See also Exercise 7.3.35.) Let 5 be the region, illustrated in Figure 2, bounded by the polar curve r - f sd and by the rays  - a and  - b, where f is a positive continuous function and where 0 , b 2 a < 2. We divide the interval fa, bg into subintervals with endpoints  0 ,  1 ,  2 , . . . ,  n and equal width D. The rays  -  i then divide 5 into n smaller regions with central angle D -  i 2  i21 . If we choose  i * in the i th subinterval f i21 ,  i g, then the area DA i of the i th region is approximated by the area of the sector of a circle with central angle D and radius f s i * d. (See Figure 3.) Thus from Formula 1 we have DA i < 1 2 f f s i * dg 2 D and so an approximation to the total area A of 5 is A < o n i-1 1 2 f f s i * dg 2 D It appears from Figure 3 that the approximation in (2) improves as n l `. But the sums in (2) are Riemann sums for the function tsd - 1 2 f f sdg 2 , so lim n l ` o n i-1 1 2 f f s i * dg 2 D - y b a 1 2 f f sdg 2 d 1 ¨ r FIGURE 1 2 O ¨=b ¨=a ¨=¨ i-1 ¨=¨ i Î¨ f(¨ i * ) FIGURE 3 O ¨=b b ¨=a r=f(¨) a  FIGURE 2 Investigate how the graph changes as the number a changes.

These curves are called the ovals of Cassini even though they are oval shaped only for certain values of a and c.

","670 CHAPTER 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates It therefore appears plausible (and can in fact be proved) that the formula for the area A of the polar region 5 is A - y b a 1 2 f f sdg 2 d Formula 3 is often written as A - y b a 1 2 r 2 d with the understanding that r - f sd. Note the similarity between Formulas 1 and 4. When we apply Formula 3 or 4, it is helpful to think of the area as being swept out by a rotating ray through O that starts with angle a and ends with angle b. EXAMPLE 1 Find the area enclosed by one loop of the four-leaved rose r - cos 2. SOLUTION The curve r - cos 2 was sketched in Example 10.3.8. Notice from Fig- ure 4 that the region enclosed by the right loop is swept out by a ray that rotates from  - 2y4 to  - y4. Therefore Formula 4 gives A - y y4 2y4 1 2 r 2 d - 1 2 y y4 2y4 cos 2 2 d - y y4 0 cos 2 2 d - y y4 0 1 2 s1 1 cos 4d d - 1 2 f 1 1 4 sin 4g 0 y4 -  8 ■ EXAMPLE 2 Find the area of the region that lies inside the circle r - 3 sin  and out- side the cardioid r - 1 1 sin . SOLUTION The cardioid (see Example 10.3.7) and the circle are sketched in Fig- ure 5 and the desired region is shaded. The values of a and b in Formula 4 are deter- mined by inding the points of intersection of the two curves. They intersect when 3 sin  - 1 1 sin , which gives sin  - 1 2 , so  - y6, 5y6. The desired area can be found by subtracting the area inside the cardioid between  - y6 and  - 5y6 from the area inside the circle from y6 to 5y6.

","SECTION 10.4 Areas and Lengths in Polar Coordinates 671 Example 2 illustrates the procedure for inding the area of the region bounded by two polar curves. In general, let 5 be a region, as illustrated in Figure 6, that is bounded by curves with polar equations r - f sd, r - tsd,  - a, and  - b, where f sd > tsd > 0 and 0 , b 2 a < 2. The area A of 5 is found by subtracting the area inside r - tsd from the area inside r - f sd, so using Formula 3 we have A - y b a 1 2 f f sdg 2 d 2 y b a 1 2 f tsdg 2 d - 1 2 y b a s f f sdg 2 2 f tsdg 2 d d CAUTION The fact that a single point has many representations in polar coordinates sometimes makes it dificult to ind all the points of intersection of two polar curves. For instance, it is obvious from Figure 5 that the circle and the cardioid have three points of intersection; however, in Example 2 we solved the equations r - 3 sin  and r - 1 1 sin  and found only two such points, ( 3 2 , y6) and ( 3 2 , 5y6). The origin is also a point of intersection, but we can’t ind it by solving the equations of the curves because the origin has no single representation in polar coordinates that satisies both equations. Notice that, when represented as s0, 0d or s0, d, the origin satisies r - 3 sin  and so it lies on the circle; when represented as s0, 3y2d, it satisies r - 1 1 sin  and so it lies on the cardioid. Think of two points moving along the curves as the parameter value  increases from 0 to 2. On one curve the origin is reached at  - 0 and  - ; on the other curve it is reached at  - 3y2. The points don’t collide at the origin because they reach the origin at different times, but the curves intersect there nonetheless. Thus, to ind all points of intersection of two polar curves, it is recommended that you draw the graphs of both curves. It is especially convenient to use a graphing calculator or computer to help with this task. EXAMPLE 3 Find all points of intersection of the curves r - cos 2 and r - 1 2 . SOLUTION If we solve the equations r - cos 2 and r - 1 2 , we get cos 2 - 1 2 and, therefore, 2 - y3, 5y3, 7y3, 11y3. Thus the values of  between 0 and 2 that satisfy both equations are  - y6, 5y6, 7y6, 11y6. We have found four points of intersection: ( 1 2 , y6), ( 1 2 , 5y6), ( 1 2 , 7y6), and ( 1 2 , 11y6). However, you can see from Figure 7 that the curves have four other points of inter- section—namely, ( 1 2 , y3), ( 1 2 , 2y3), ( 1 2 , 4y3), and ( 1 2 , 5y3). These can be found using symmetry or by noticing that another equation of the circle is r - 2 1 2 and then solving the equations r - cos 2 and r - 2 1 2 . ■ Arc Length To ind the length of a polar curve r - f sd, a <  < b, we regard  as a parameter and write the parametric equations of the curve as x - r cos  - f sd cos  y - r sin  - f sd sin  Using the Product Rule and differentiating with respect to , we obtain dx d - dr d cos  2 r sin  dy d - dr d sin  1 r cos  O ¨=b ¨=a r=f(¨)  r=g(¨) FIGURE 6 FIGURE 7 r=cos 2¨ 1 2 r= ” , ’ 1 2 π 3 ” , ’ 1 2 π 6 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","674 CHAPTER 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates In this section we give geometric deinitions of parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas and derive their standard equations. They are called conic sections, or conics, because they result from intersecting a cone with a plane as shown in Figure 1. ellipse hyperbola parabola Parabolas A parabola is the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a ixed point F (called the focus) and a ixed line (called the directrix). This definition is illustrated by Figure 2. Notice that the point halfway between the focus and the directrix lies on the parabola; it is called the vertex. The line through the focus perpendicular to the directrix is called the axis of the parabola. In the 16th century Galileo showed that the path of a projectile that is shot into the air at an angle to the ground is a parabola. Since then, parabolic shapes have been used in designing automobile headlights, relecting telescopes, and suspension bridges. (See Problem 22 on page 273 for the relection property of parabolas that makes them so useful.) We obtain a particularly simple equation for a parabola if we place its vertex at the origin O and its directrix parallel to the x-axis as in Figure 3. If the focus is the point s0, pd, then the directrix has the equation y - 2p. If Ps x, yd is any point on the parabola, axis F focus parabola vertex directrix FIGURE 2 51–54 Use a calculator to ind the length of the curve correct to four decimal places.

(Figure 3 illustrates the case where p . 0.) The deining property of a parabola is that these distances are equal: sx 2 1 s y 2 pd 2 - | y 1 p | We get an equivalent equation by squaring and simplifying: x 2 1 s y 2 pd 2 - | y 1 p | 2 - s y 1 pd 2 x 2 1 y 2 2 2py 1 p 2 - y 2 1 2py 1 p 2 x 2 - 4py 1 An equation of the parabola with focus s0, pd and directrix y - 2p is x 2 - 4py If we write a - 1 ys4pd, then the standard equation of a parabola (1) becomes y - ax 2 . It opens upward if p . 0 and downward if p , 0 [see Figure 4, parts (a) and (b)]. The graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis because (1) is unchanged when x is replaced by 2x. 0 x y ( p, 0) x=_p (d) ¥=4px, p<0 0 x y ( p, 0) x=_p (c) ¥=4px, p>0 0 x y (0, p) y=_p (b) ≈=4py, p<0 0 x y (0, p) y=_p (a) ≈=4py, p>0 If we interchange x and y in (1), we obtain y 2 - 4px which is an equation of the parabola with focus s p, 0d and directrix x - 2p. (Inter- changing x and y amounts to relecting about the diagonal line y - x.) The parabola opens to the right if p . 0 and to the left if p , 0 [see Figure 4, parts (c) and (d)]. In both cases the graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis, which is the axis of the parabola. EXAMPLE 1 Find the focus and directrix of the parabola y 2 1 10x - 0 and sketch the graph.

","676 CHAPTER 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates Ellipses An ellipse is the set of points in a plane the sum of whose distances from two ixed points F 1 and F 2 is a constant (see Figure 6).

Let the sum of the distances from a point on the ellipse to the foci be 2a . 0. Then Ps x, yd is a point on the ellipse when | PF 1 | 1 | PF 2 | - 2a that is, ss x 1 cd 2 1 y 2 1 ss x 2 cd 2 1 y 2 - 2a or ss x 2 cd 2 1 y 2 - 2a 2 ss x 1 cd 2 1 y 2 Squaring both sides, we have x 2 2 2cx 1 c 2 1 y 2 - 4a 2 2 4a ss x 1 cd 2 1 y 2 1 x 2 1 2cx 1 c 2 1 y 2 which simpliies to a ss x 1 cd 2 1 y 2 - a 2 1 cx We square again: a 2 s x 2 1 2cx 1 c 2 1 y 2 d - a 4 1 2a 2 cx 1 c 2 x 2 which becomes sa 2 2 c 2 d x 2 1 a 2 y 2 - a 2 sa 2 2 c 2 d From triangle F 1 F 2 P in Figure 7 we can see that 2c , 2a, so c , a and therefore a 2 2 c 2 . 0. For convenience, let b 2 - a 2 2 c 2 . Then the equation of the ellipse becomes b 2 x 2 1 a 2 y 2 - a 2 b 2 or, if both sides are divided by a 2 b 2 , x 2 a 2 1 y 2 b 2 - 1 Since b 2 - a 2 2 c 2 , a 2 , it follows that b , a. The x-intercepts are found by setting y - 0. Then x 2 ya 2 - 1, or x 2 - a 2 , so x - 6a. The corresponding points sa, 0d and s2a, 0d are called the vertices of the ellipse and the line segment joining the vertices is called the major axis. To ind the y-intercepts we set x - 0 and obtain y 2 - b 2 , so y - 6b. The line segment joining s0, bd and s0, 2bd is the minor axis. Equation 3 is unchanged if x is replaced by 2x or y is replaced by 2y, so the ellipse is symmetric about both axes. Notice that if the foci coincide, then c - 0, so a - b and the ellipse becomes a circle with radius r - a - b. We summarize this discussion as follows (see also Figure 8). 3 FIGURE 8 x 2 a 2 1 y 2 b 2 - 1, a > b (c, 0) 0 x y a b c (0, b) (_c, 0) (0, _b) (a, 0) (_a, 0) Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

SOLUTION Divide both sides of the equation by 144: x 2 16 1 y 2 9 - 1 The equation is now in the standard form for an ellipse, so we have a 2 - 16, b 2 - 9, a - 4, and b - 3. The x-intercepts are 64 and the y-intercepts are 63. Also, c 2 - a 2 2 b 2 - 7, so c - s7 and the foci are s6s7 , 0d. The graph is sketched in Figure 10. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Find an equation of the ellipse with foci s0, 62d and vertices s0, 63d. SOLUTION Using the notation of (5), we have c - 2 and a - 3. Then we obtain b 2 - a 2 2 c 2 - 9 2 4 - 5, so an equation of the ellipse is x 2 5 1 y 2 9 - 1 Another way of writing the equation is 9x 2 1 5y 2 - 45. ■ Like parabolas, ellipses have an interesting relection property that has practical con- sequences. If a source of light or sound is placed at one focus of a surface with elliptical cross-sections, then all the light or sound is relected off the surface to the other focus (see Exercise 65). This principle is used in lithotripsy, a treatment for kidney stones. A relector with elliptical cross-section is placed in such a way that the kidney stone is at one focus. High-intensity sound waves generated at the other focus are relected to the stone and destroy it without damaging surrounding tissue. The patient is spared the trauma of surgery and recovers within a few days. Hyperbolas A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane the difference of whose distances from two ixed points F 1 and F 2 (the foci) is a constant. This deinition is illustrated in Figure 11. Hyperbolas occur frequently as graphs of equations in chemistry, physics, biology, and economics (Boyle’s Law, Ohm’s Law, supply and demand curves).

","678 CHAPTER 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates signiicant application of hyperbolas was found in the navigation systems developed in World Wars I and II (see Exercise 51). Notice that the deinition of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse; the only change is that the sum of distances has become a difference of distances. In fact, the derivation of the equation of a hyperbola is also similar to the one given earlier for an ellipse. It is left as Exercise 52 to show that when the foci are on the x-axis at s6c, 0d and the difference of distances is | PF 1 | 2 | PF 2 | - 62a, then the equation of the hyperbola is x 2 a 2 2 y 2 b 2 - 1 where c 2 - a 2 1 b 2 . Notice that the x-intercepts are again 6a and the points sa, 0d and s2a, 0d are the vertices of the hyperbola. But if we put x - 0 in Equation 6 we get y 2 - 2b 2 , which is impossible, so there is no y-intercept. The hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes. To analyze the hyperbola further, we look at Equation 6 and obtain x 2 a 2 - 1 1 y 2 b 2 > 1 This shows that x 2 > a 2 , so | x | - sx 2 > a. Therefore we have x > a or x <2a. This means that the hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches. When we draw a hyperbola it is useful to irst draw its asymptotes, which are the dashed lines y - sb yad x and y - 2sb yad x shown in Figure 12. Both branches of the hyperbola approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the asymp- totes. (See Exercise 4.5.73, where these lines are shown to be slant asymptotes.) 7 The hyperbola x 2 a 2 2 y 2 b 2 - 1 has foci s6c, 0d, where c 2 - a 2 1 b 2 , vertices s6a, 0d, and asymptotes y - 6sb yad x. If the foci of a hyperbola are on the y-axis, then by reversing the roles of x and y we obtain the following information, which is illustrated in Figure 13. 8 The hyperbola y 2 a 2 2 x 2 b 2 - 1 has foci s0, 6cd, where c 2 - a 2 1 b 2 , vertices s0, 6ad, and asymptotes y - 6saybd x.

Since c 2 - 16 1 9 - 25, the foci are s65, 0d. The asymptotes are the lines y - 3 4 x and y - 2 3 4 x. The graph is shown in Figure 14. ■ EXAMPLE 5 Find the foci and equation of the hyperbola with vertices s0, 61d and asymptote y - 2x. SOLUTION From (8) and the given information, we see that a - 1 and ayb - 2. Thus b - ay2 - 1 2 and c 2 - a 2 1 b 2 - 5 4 . The foci are s0, 6s5 y2d and the equation of the hyperbola is y 2 2 4x 2 - 1 ■ Shifted Conics As discussed in Appendix C, we shift conics by taking the standard equations (1), (2), (4), (5), (7), and (8) and replacing x and y by x 2 h and y 2 k. EXAMPLE 6 Find an equation of the ellipse with foci s2, 22d, s4, 22d and vertices s1, 22d, s5, 22d. SOLUTION The major axis is the line segment that joins the vertices s1, 22d, s5, 22d and has length 4, so a - 2. The distance between the foci is 2, so c - 1. Thus b 2 - a 2 2 c 2 - 3. Since the center of the ellipse is s3, 22d, we replace x and y in (4) by x 2 3 and y 1 2 to obtain s x 2 3d 2 4 1 s y 1 2d 2 3 - 1 as the equation of the ellipse. ■ EXAMPLE 7 Sketch the conic 9x 2 2 4y 2 2 72 x 1 8y 1 176 - 0 and ind its foci. SOLUTION We complete the squares as follows: 4s y 2 2 2yd 2 9s x 2 2 8xd - 176 4s y 2 2 2y 1 1d 2 9s x 2 2 8x 1 16d - 176 1 4 2 144 4s y 2 1d 2 2 9s x 2 4d 2 - 36 s y 2 1d 2 9 2 s x 2 4d 2 4 - 1 This is in the form (8) except that x and y are replaced by x 2 4 and y 2 1. Thus a 2 - 9, b 2 - 4, and c 2 - 13. The hyperbola is shifted four units to the right and one unit upward. The foci are (4, 1 1 s13 ) and (4, 1 2 s13 ) and the vertices are s4, 4d and s4, 22d.

The LORAN (LOng RAnge Navigation) radio navigation system was widely used until the 1990s when it was super- seded by the GPS system. In the LORAN system, two radio stations located at A and B transmit simultaneous signals to a ship or an aircraft located at P. The onboard computer converts the time difference in receiving these signals into a distance difference | PA | 2 | PB | , and this, according to the deinition of a hyperbola, locates the ship or aircraft on one branch of a hyperbola (see the igure).

Furthermore, if we place the focus at the origin, then a conic section has a simple polar equation, which provides a convenient description of the motion of planets, satellites, and comets. 1 Theorem Let F be a ixed point (called the focus) and l be a ixed line (called the directrix) in a plane.

Kepler’s Laws 1. A planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus. 2. The line joining the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. 3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the length of the major axis of its orbit. Although Kepler formulated his laws in terms of the motion of planets around the sun, they apply equally well to the motion of moons, comets, satellites, and other bodies that orbit subject to a single gravitational force. In Section 13.4 we will show how to deduce Kepler’s Laws from Newton’s Laws. Here we use Kepler’s First Law, together with the polar equation of an ellipse, to calculate quantities of interest in astronomy. For purposes of astronomical calculations, it’s useful to express the equation of an ellipse in terms of its eccentricity e and its semimajor axis a. We can write the distance d from the focus to the directrix in terms of a if we use (4): a 2 - e 2 d 2 s1 2 e 2 d 2 ? d 2 - a 2 s1 2 e 2 d 2 e 2 ? d - as1 2 e 2 d e So ed - as1 2 e 2 d.

The distances from the sun to the perihelion and aphelion are called the perihelion distance and aphelion distance, respectively.

Infinite Sequences and Series INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES WERE introduced briely in A Preview of Calculus in con- nection with Zeno’s paradoxes and the decimal representation of numbers. Their importance in calculus stems from Newton’s idea of representing functions as sums of ininite series. For instance, in inding areas he often integrated a function by irst expressing it as a series and then integrating each term of the series. We will pursue his idea in Section 11.10 in order to integrate such functions as e 2x 2 . (Recall that we have previously been unable to do this.) Many of the func- tions that arise in mathematical physics and chemistry, such as Bessel functions, are deined as sums of series, so it is important to be familiar with the basic concepts of convergence of ininite sequences and series. Physicists also use series in another way, as we will see in Section 11.11. In studying ields as diverse as optics, special relativity, and electromagnetism, they analyze phenomena by replacing a function with the irst few terms in the series that represents it. 11 STScI / NASA / ESA / Galaxy / Galaxy Picture Library / Alamy Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","694 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series A sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a deinite order: a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , ..., a n , . . . The number a 1 is called the irst term, a 2 is the second term, and in general a n is the nth term. We will deal exclusively with ininite sequences and so each term a n will have a successor a n11 . Notice that for every positive integer n there is a corresponding number a n and so a sequence can be deined as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. But we usually write a n instead of the function notation f snd for the value of the function at the number n. NOTATION The sequence {a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , . . .} is also denoted by ha n j or ha n j n-1 ` EXAMPLE 1 Some sequences can be deined by giving a formula for the nth term. In the following examples we give three descriptions of the sequence: one by using the preceding notation, another by using the deining formula, and a third by writing out the terms of the sequence.

The signs of the terms are alternately positive and negative, so we need to multiply by a power of 21. In Example 1(b) the factor s21d n meant we started with a negative term. Here we want to start with a positive term and so we use s21d n21 or s21d n11 . Therefore a n - s21d n21 n 1 2 5 n ■ EXAMPLE 3 Here are some sequences that don’t have a simple deining equation. (a) The sequence h p n j, where p n is the population of the world as of January 1 in the year n. (b) If we let a n be the digit in the nth decimal place of the number e, then ha n j is a well-deined sequence whose irst few terms are h7, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 8, 4, 5, . . .j (c) The Fibonacci sequence h f n j is deined recursively by the conditions f 1 - 1 f 2 - 1 f n - f n21 1 f n22 n > 3 Each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. The irst few terms are h1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . .j This sequence arose when the 13th-century Italian mathematician known as Fibonacci solved a problem concerning the breeding of rabbits (see Exercise 83). ■ A sequence such as the one in Example 1(a), a n - nysn 1 1d, can be pictured either by plotting its terms on a number line, as in Figure 1, or by plotting its graph, as in Fig- ure 2. Note that, since a sequence is a function whose domain is the set of positive inte- gers, its graph consists of isolated points with coordinates s1, a 1 d s2, a 2 d s3, a 3 d . . . sn, a n d . . . From Figure 1 or Figure 2 it appears that the terms of the sequence a n - nysn 1 1d are approaching 1 as n becomes large. In fact, the difference 1 2 n n 1 1 - 1 n 1 1 can be made as small as we like by taking n suficiently large. We indicate this by writing lim n l` n n 1 1 - 1 In general, the notation lim n l` a n - L means that the terms of the sequence ha n j approach L as n becomes large.

Squeeze Theorem for Sequences Another useful fact about limits of sequences is given by the following theorem, whose proof is left as Exercise 87. 6 Theorem If lim n l` | a n | - 0, then lim n l` a n - 0. EXAMPLE 4 Find lim n l` n n 1 1 . SOLUTION The method is similar to the one we used in Section 2.6: Divide numerator and denominator by the highest power of n that occurs in the denominator and then use the Limit Laws. lim n l ` n n 1 1 - lim n l ` 1 1 1 1 n - lim n l ` 1 lim n l ` 1 1 lim n l ` 1 n - 1 1 1 0 - 1 Here we used Equation 4 with r - 1. ■ EXAMPLE 5 Is the sequence a n - n s10 1 n convergent or divergent? SOLUTION As in Example 4, we divide numerator and denominator by n: lim n l ` n s10 1 n - lim n l ` 1 Î 10 n 2 1 1 n - ` because the numerator is constant and the denominator approaches 0. So ha n j is divergent. ■ EXAMPLE 6 Calculate lim n l ` ln n n . SOLUTION Notice that both numerator and denominator approach ininity as n l `. We can’t apply l’Hospital’s Rule directly because it applies not to sequences but to functions of a real variable. However, we can apply l’Hospital’s Rule to the related function f s xd - sln xdyx and obtain lim x l ` ln x x - lim x l ` 1yx 1 - 0 Therefore, by Theorem 3, we have lim n l ` ln n n - 0 ■ 0 n c n a n b n FIGURE 7 The sequence h bn j is squeezed between the sequences h an j and h c n j .

SOLUTION If we write out the terms of the sequence, we obtain h21, 1, 21, 1, 21, 1, 21, . . .j The graph of this sequence is shown in Figure 8. Since the terms oscillate between 1 and 21 ininitely often, a n does not approach any number. Thus lim n l ` s21d n does not exist; that is, the sequence hs21d n j is divergent. ■ EXAMPLE 8 Evaluate lim n l ` s21d n n if it exists.

SOLUTION Both numerator and denominator approach ininity as n l ` but here we have no corresponding function for use with l’Hospital’s Rule (x! is not deined when x is not an integer).

SOLUTION 1 We must show that a n11 , a n , that is, n 1 1 sn 1 1d 2 1 1 , n n 2 1 1 This inequality is equivalent to the one we get by cross-multiplication: n 1 1 sn 1 1d 2 1 1 , n n 2 1 1 &? sn 1 1dsn 2 1 1d , nfsn 1 1d 2 1 1g &? n 3 1 n 2 1 n 1 1 , n 3 1 2n 2 1 2n &? 1 , n 2 1 n Since n > 1, we know that the inequality n 2 1 n . 1 is true. Therefore a n11 , a n and so ha n j is decreasing.

For instance, the sequence a n - n is bounded below sa n . 0d but not above. The sequence a n - nysn 1 1d is bounded because 0 , a n , 1 for all n. We know that not every bounded sequence is convergent [for instance, the sequence a n - s21d n satisies 21 < a n < 1 but is divergent from Example 7] and not every The right side is smaller because it has a larger denominator.

","702 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series monotonic sequence is convergent sa n - n l `d. But if a sequence is both bounded and monotonic, then it must be convergent. This fact is proved as Theorem 12, but intuitively you can understand why it is true by looking at Figure 12. If ha n j is increasing and a n < M for all n, then the terms are forced to crowd together and approach some num- ber L. 2 0 n a n 1 3 L M The proof of Theorem 12 is based on the Completeness Axiom for the set R of real numbers, which says that if S is a nonempty set of real numbers that has an upper bound M (x < M for all x in S), then S has a least upper bound b. (This means that b is an upper bound for S, but if M is any other upper bound, then b < M.) The Completeness Axiom is an expression of the fact that there is no gap or hole in the real number line. 12 Monotonic Sequence Theorem Every bounded, monotonic sequence is convergent. PROOF Suppose ha n j is an increasing sequence. Since ha n j is bounded, the set S - ha n | n > 1j has an upper bound. By the Completeness Axiom it has a least upper bound L. Given «. 0, L 2« is not an upper bound for S (since L is the least upper bound). Therefore a N . L 2« for some integer N But the sequence is increasing so a n > a N for every n . N. Thus if n . N, we have a n . L 2« so 0 < L 2 a n ,« since a n < L. Thus | L 2 a n | ,« whenever n . N so lim n l ` a n - L. A similar proof (using the greatest lower bound) works if ha n j is decreasing. ■ The proof of Theorem 12 shows that a sequence that is increasing and bounded above is convergent. (Likewise, a decreasing sequence that is bounded below is convergent.) This fact is used many times in dealing with ininite series. FIGURE 12 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

SOLUTION We begin by computing the irst several terms: a 1 - 2 a 2 - 1 2 s2 1 6d - 4 a 3 - 1 2 s4 1 6d - 5 a 4 - 1 2 s5 1 6d - 5.5 a 5 - 5.75 a 6 - 5.875 a 7 - 5.9375 a 8 - 5.96875 a 9 - 5.984375 These initial terms suggest that the sequence is increasing and the terms are approach- ing 6. To conirm that the sequence is increasing, we use mathematical induction to show that a n11 . a n for all n > 1. This is true for n - 1 because a 2 - 4 . a 1 . If we assume that it is true for n - k, then we have a k11 . a k so a k11 1 6 . a k 1 6 and 1 2 sa k11 1 6d . 1 2 sa k 1 6d Thus a k12 . a k11 We have deduced that a n11 . a n is true for n - k 1 1. Therefore the inequality is true for all n by induction. Next we verify that ha n j is bounded by showing that a n , 6 for all n. (Since the sequence is increasing, we already know that it has a lower bound: a n > a 1 - 2 for all n.) We know that a 1 , 6, so the assertion is true for n - 1. Suppose it is true for n - k. Then a k , 6 so a k 1 6 , 12 and 1 2 sa k 1 6d , 1 2 s12d - 6 Thus a k11 , 6 This shows, by mathematical induction, that a n , 6 for all n. Since the sequence ha n j is increasing and bounded, Theorem 12 guarantees that it has a limit. The theorem doesn’t tell us what the value of the limit is. But now that we know L - lim n l` a n exists, we can use the given recurrence relation to write lim n l` a n11 - lim n l` 1 2 sa n 1 6d - 1 2 a lim n l` a n 1 6b - 1 2 sL 1 6d Since a n l L, it follows that a n11 l L too (as n l `, n 1 1 l ` also). So we have L - 1 2 sL 1 6d Solving this equation for L, we get L - 6, as we predicted. ■ Mathematical induction is often used in dealing with recursive sequences.

","SECTION 11.2 Series 707 LOGISTIC SEQUENCES CAS LABORATORY PROJECT A sequence that arises in ecology as a model for population growth is deined by the logistic difference equation pn11 - kpns1 2 pn d where pn measures the size of the population of the nth generation of a single species. To keep the numbers manageable, pn is a fraction of the maximal size of the population, so 0 < pn < 1. Notice that the form of this equation is similar to the logistic differential equation in Section 9.4. The discrete model—with sequences instead of continuous functions—is preferable for modeling insect populations, where mating and death occur in a periodic fashion. An ecologist is interested in predicting the size of the population as time goes on, and asks these questions: Will it stabilize at a limiting value? Will it change in a cyclical fashion? Or will it exhibit random behavior? Write a program to compute the irst n terms of this sequence starting with an initial pop- ulation p0, where 0 , p0 , 1. Use this program to do the following. 1. Calculate 20 or 30 terms of the sequence for p0 - 1 2 and for two values of k such that 1 , k , 3. Graph each sequence. Do the sequences appear to converge? Repeat for a differ- ent value of p0 between 0 and 1. Does the limit depend on the choice of p0? Does it depend on the choice of k? 2. Calculate terms of the sequence for a value of k between 3 and 3.4 and plot them. What do you notice about the behavior of the terms? 3. Experiment with values of k between 3.4 and 3.5. What happens to the terms? 4. For values of k between 3.6 and 4, compute and plot at least 100 terms and comment on the behavior of the sequence. What happens if you change p0 by 0.001? This type of behavior is called chaotic and is exhibited by insect populations under certain conditions. What do we mean when we express a number as an ininite decimal? For instance, what does it mean to write  - 3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 83279 50288 . . . The convention behind our decimal notation is that any number can be written as an ini- nite sum. Here it means that  - 3 1 1 10 1 4 10 2 1 1 10 3 1 5 10 4 1 9 10 5 1 2 10 6 1 6 10 7 1 5 10 8 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ where the three dots s∙ ∙ ∙d indicate that the sum continues forever, and the more terms we add, the closer we get to the actual value of . In general, if we try to add the terms of an ininite sequence ha n j n-1 ` we get an expres- sion of the form a 1 1 a 2 1 a 3 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 a n 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ which is called an ininite series (or just a series) and is denoted, for short, by the symbol o ` n-1 a n or o a n Does it make sense to talk about the sum of ininitely many terms? The current record for computing a decimal approximation for  was obtained by Shigeru Kondo and Alex- ander Yee in 2011 and contains more than 10 trillion decimal places. 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","708 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series It would be impossible to ind a inite sum for the series 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 ∙∙∙ 1 n 1 ∙∙∙ because if we start adding the terms we get the cumulative sums 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, . . . and, after the nth term, we get nsn 1 1dy2, which becomes very large as n increases. However, if we start to add the terms of the series 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 1 1 32 1 1 64 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 1 2 n 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ we get 1 2 , 3 4 , 7 8 , 15 16 , 31 32 , 63 64 , . . . , 1 2 1 y2 n , . . . . The table shows that as we add more and more terms, these partial sums become closer and closer to 1. (See also Figure 11 in A Preview of Calculus, page 6.) In fact, by adding suficiently many terms of the series we can make the partial sums as close as we like to 1. So it seems reasonable to say that the sum of this ininite series is 1 and to write o ` n-1 1 2 n - 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 1 2 n 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ - 1 We use a similar idea to determine whether or not a general series (1) has a sum. We consider the partial sums s 1 - a 1 s 2 - a 1 1 a 2 s 3 - a 1 1 a 2 1 a 3 s 4 - a 1 1 a 2 1 a 3 1 a 4 and, in general, s n - a 1 1 a 2 1 a 3 1 ∙∙∙ 1 a n - o n i-1 a i These partial sums form a new sequence hs n j , which may or may not have a limit. If lim n l ` s n - s exists (as a inite number), then, as in the preceding example, we call it the sum of the ininite series o a n . 2 Deinition Given a series o ` n-1 a n - a 1 1 a 2 1 a 3 1 ∙ ∙ ∙, let s n denote its nth partial sum: s n - o n i-1 a i - a 1 1 a 2 1 ∙∙∙ 1 a n If the sequence hs n j is convergent and lim n l ` s n - s exists as a real number, then the series o a n is called convergent and we write a 1 1 a 2 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 a n 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ - s or o ` n-1 a n - s The number s is called the sum of the series. If the sequence hs n j is divergent, then the series is called divergent . n Sum of irst n terms 1 0.50000000 2 0.75000000 3 0.87500000 4 0.93750000 5 0.96875000 6 0.98437500 7 0.99218750 10 0.99902344 15 0.99996948 20 0.99999905 25 0.99999997 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 11.2 Series 709 Thus the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. So when we write o ` n-1 a n - s, we mean that by adding suficiently many terms of the series we can get as close as we like to the number s. Notice that o ` n-1 a n - lim n l` o n i-1 a i EXAMPLE 1 Suppose we know that the sum of the irst n terms of the series o ` n-1 a n is s n - a 1 1 a 2 1 ∙∙∙ 1 a n - 2n 3n 1 5 Then the sum of the series is the limit of the sequence hs n j: o ` n-1 a n - lim n l` s n - lim n l` 2n 3n 1 5 - lim n l` 2 3 1 5 n - 2 3 ■ In Example 1 we were given an expression for the sum of the irst n terms, but it’s usually not easy to ind such an expression. In Example 2, however, we look at a famous series for which we can ind an explicit formula for s n . EXAMPLE 2 An important example of an ininite series is the geometric series a 1 ar 1 ar 2 1 ar 3 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 ar n21 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ - o ` n-1 ar n21 a ± 0 Each term is obtained from the preceding one by multiplying it by the common ratio r. (We have already considered the special case where a - 1 2 and r - 1 2 on page 708.) If r - 1, then s n - a 1 a 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 a - na l 6`. Since lim n l ` s n doesn’t exist, the geometric series diverges in this case. If r ± 1, we have s n - a 1 ar 1 ar 2 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 ar n21 and rs n - ar 1 ar 2 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 ar n21 1 ar n Subtracting these equations, we get s n 2 rs n - a 2 ar n s n - as1 2 r n d 1 2 r If 21 , r , 1, we know from (11.1.9) that r n l 0 as n l `, so lim n l` s n - lim n l` as1 2 r n d 1 2 r - a 1 2 r 2 a 1 2 r lim n l` r n - a 1 2 r Thus when | r | , 1 the geometric series is convergent and its sum is ays1 2 rd. If r <21 or r . 1, the sequence hr n j is divergent by (11.1.9) and so, by Equation 3, lim n l ` s n does not exist. Therefore the geometric series diverges in those cases. ■ Compare with the improper integral y ` 1 f s xd dx - lim t l` y t 1 f s xd dx To ind this integral we integrate from 1 to t and then let t l `. For a series, we sum from 1 to n and then let n l `. Figure 1 provides a geometric demon- stration of the result in Example 2. If the triangles are constructed as shown and s is the sum of the series, then, by similar triangles, s a - a a 2 ar so s - a 1 2 r a a a ar a-ar ar ar@ ar# ar@ s FIGURE 1 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Since r . 1, the series diverges by (4). ■ EXAMPLE 5 A drug is administered to a patient at the same time every day. Suppose the concentration of the drug is C n (measured in mgymL) after the injection on the n th day. Before the injection the next day, only 30% of the drug remains in the bloodstream and the daily dose raises the concentration by 0.2 mgymL. (a) Find the concentration after three days. What do we really mean when we say that the sum of the series in Example 3 is 3? Of course, we can’t literally add an ininite number of terms, one by one. But, according to Deinition 2, the total sum is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. So, by taking the sum of suficiently many terms, we can get as close as we like to the number 3. The table shows the irst ten partial sums sn and the graph in Figure 2 shows how the sequence of partial sums approaches 3.

SOLUTION (a) Just before the daily dose of medication is administered, the concentration is reduced to 30% of the preceding day’s concentration, that is, 0.3C n . With the new dose, the concentration is increased by 0.2 mgymL and so C n11 - 0.2 1 0.3C n Starting with C 0 - 0 and putting n - 0, 1, 2 into this equation, we get C 1 - 0.2 1 0.3C 0 - 0.2 C 2 - 0.2 1 0.3C 1 - 0.2 1 0.2s0.3d - 0.26 C 3 - 0.2 1 0.3C 2 - 0.2 1 0.2s0.3d 1 0.2s0.3d 2 - 0.278 The concentration after three days is 0.278 mgymL.

Therefore the harmonic series diverges. ■ 6 Theorem If the series o ` n-1 a n is convergent, then lim n l ` a n - 0. PROOF Let s n - a 1 1 a 2 1 ∙∙∙ 1 a n . Then a n - s n 2 s n21 . Since o a n is conver- gent, the sequence hs n j is convergent. Let lim n l ` s n - s. Since n 2 1 l ` as n l `, we also have lim n l ` s n21 - s. Therefore lim n l` a n - lim n l` ss n 2 s n21 d - lim n l` s n 2 lim n l` s n21 - s 2 s - 0 ■ NOTE 1 With any series o a n we associate two sequences: the sequence hs n j of its partial sums and the sequence ha n j of its terms. If o a n is convergent, then the limit of the sequence hs n j is s (the sum of the series) and, as Theorem 6 asserts, the limit of the sequence ha n j is 0. NOTE 2 The converse of Theorem 6 is not true in general. If lim n l ` a n - 0, we can- not conclude that o a n is convergent. Observe that for the harmonic series o 1 yn we have a n - 1 yn l 0 as n l `, but we showed in Example 9 that o 1 yn is divergent. 7 Test for Divergence If lim n l` a n does not exist or if lim n l` a n ± 0, then the series o ` n-1 a n is divergent. The method used in Example 9 for showing that the harmonic series diverges is due to the French scholar Nicole Oresme (1323–1382). Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

If we ind that lim n l ` a n - 0, we know nothing about the convergence or divergence of o a n . Remember the warning in Note 2: if lim n l ` a n - 0, the series o a n might converge or it might diverge. 8 Theorem If o a n and o b n are convergent series, then so are the series o ca n (where c is a constant), osa n 1 b n d, and osa n 2 b n d, and (i) o ` n-1 ca n - c o ` n-1 a n (ii) o ` n-1 sa n 1 b n d - o ` n-1 a n 1 o ` n-1 b n (iii) o ` n-1 sa n 2 b n d - o ` n-1 a n 2 o ` n-1 b n These properties of convergent series follow from the corresponding Limit Laws for Sequences in Section 11.1.

When money is spent on goods and services, those who receive the money also spend some of it. The people receiv- ing some of the twice-spent money will spend some of that, and so on. Economists call this chain reaction the multiplier effect. In a hypothetical isolated community, the local govern- ment begins the process by spending D dollars. Suppose that each recipient of spent money spends 100c % and saves 100s % of the money that he or she receives.

The Cantor set, named after the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845–1918), is constructed as follows. We start with the closed interval [0, 1] and remove the open interval ( 1 3 , 2 3 ). That leaves the two intervals f0, 1 3 g and f 2 3 , 1g and we remove the open middle third of each. Four intervals remain and again we remove the open middle third of each of them. We continue this procedure indeinitely, at each step removing the open middle third of every interval that remains from the preceding step. The Cantor set consists of the numbers that remain in [0, 1] after all those intervals have been removed. (a) Show that the total length of all the intervals that are removed is 1. Despite that, the Cantor set contains ini- nitely many numbers. Give examples of some numbers in the Cantor set. (b) The Sierpinski carpet is a two-dimensional counterpart of the Cantor set.

In the igure at the right there are ininitely many circles approaching the vertices of an equilateral triangle, each circle touching other circles and sides of the triangle. If the triangle has sides of length 1, ind the total area occupied by the circles. In general, it is dificult to ind the exact sum of a series. We were able to accomplish this for geometric series and the series o 1 yfnsn 1 1dg because in each of those cases we could ind a simple formula for the nth partial sum s n . But usually it isn’t easy to discover such a formula. Therefore, in the next few sections, we develop several tests that enable us to determine whether a series is convergent or divergent without explicitly inding its sum. (In some cases, however, our methods will enable us to ind good estimates of the sum.) Our irst test involves improper integrals. We begin by investigating the series whose terms are the reciprocals of the squares of the positive integers: o ` n-1 1 n 2 - 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 1 1 4 2 1 1 5 2 1 ∙∙∙ There’s no simple formula for the sum s n of the irst n terms, but the computer-generated table of approximate values given in the margin suggests that the partial sums are approaching a number near 1.64 as n l ` and so it looks as if the series is convergent. We can conirm this impression with a geometric argument. Figure 1 shows the curve y - 1 yx 2 and rectangles that lie below the curve. The base of each rectangle is an interval of length 1; the height is equal to the value of the function y - 1 yx 2 at the right endpoint of the interval. x y 0 2 1 3 4 5 y= 1 ≈ area= 1 1@ area= 1 2@ area= 1 3@ area= 1 4@ area= 1 5@ n sn - o n i-1 1 i 2 5 1.4636 10 1.5498 50 1.6251 100 1.6350 500 1.6429 1000 1.6439 5000 1.6447 FIGURE 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In Section 7.8 we discovered that this improper integral is convergent and has value 1. So the picture shows that all the partial sums are less than 1 1 2 1 y ` 1 1 x 2 dx - 2 Thus the partial sums are bounded. We also know that the partial sums are increasing (because all the terms are positive). Therefore the partial sums converge (by the Mono- tonic Sequence Theorem) and so the series is convergent. The sum of the series (the limit of the partial sums) is also less than 2: o ` n-1 1 n 2 - 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 1 1 4 2 1 ∙∙∙ , 2 [The exact sum of this series was found by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) to be  2 y6, but the proof of this fact is quite dificult. (See Problem 6 in the Problems Plus following Chapter 15.)] Now let’s look at the series o ` n-1 1 sn - 1 s1 1 1 s2 1 1 s3 1 1 s4 1 1 s5 1 ∙∙∙ The table of values of s n suggests that the partial sums aren’t approaching a inite num- ber, so we suspect that the given series may be divergent.

","SECTION 11.3 The Integral Test and Estimates of Sums 721 equal to the integral y ` 1 (1 ysx ) dx. But we know from Section 7.8 that this improper integral is divergent. In other words, the area under the curve is ininite. So the sum of the series must be ininite; that is, the series is divergent. The same sort of geometric reasoning that we used for these two series can be used to prove the following test. (The proof is given at the end of this section.) The Integral Test Suppose f is a continuous, positive, decreasing function on f1, `d and let a n - f snd. Then the series o ` n-1 an is convergent if and only if the improper integral y ` 1 f s xd dx is convergent. In other words: (i) If y ` 1 f s xd dx is convergent, then o ` n-1 a n is convergent. (ii) If y ` 1 f s xd dx is divergent, then o ` n-1 a n is divergent. NOTE When we use the Integral Test, it is not necessary to start the series or the integral at n - 1. For instance, in testing the series o ` n-4 1 sn 2 3d 2 we use y ` 4 1 s x 2 3d 2 dx Also, it is not necessary that f be always decreasing. What is important is that f be ultimately decreasing, that is, decreasing for x larger than some number N. Then o ` n-N an is convergent, so o ` n-1 an is convergent by Note 4 of Section 11.2. EXAMPLE 1 Test the series o ` n-1 1 n 2 1 1 for convergence or divergence. SOLUTION The function f s xd - 1 ys x 2 1 1d is continuous, positive, and decreasing on f1, `d so we use the Integral Test: y ` 1 1 x 2 1 1 dx - lim t l` y t 1 1 x 2 1 1 dx - lim t l` tan 21 xg 1 t - lim t l` S tan 21 t 2  4 D -  2 2  4 -  4 Thus y ` 1 1 ys x 2 1 1d dx is a convergent integral and so, by the Integral Test, the series o 1 ysn 2 1 1d is convergent. ■ EXAMPLE 2 For what values of p is the series o ` n-1 1 n p convergent? SOLUTION If p , 0, then lim n l` s1 yn p d - `. If p - 0, then lim n l` s1 yn p d - 1. In either case lim n l` s1 yn p d ± 0, so the given series diverges by the Test for Divergence (11.2.7). If p . 0, then the function f s xd - 1 yx p is clearly continuous, positive, and decreas- ing on f1, `d. We found in Chapter 7 [see (7.8.2)] that y ` 1 1 x p dx converges if p . 1 and diverges if p < 1 In order to use the Integral Test we need to be able to evaluate y ` 1 f s xd dx and therefore we have to be able to ind an antiderivative of f . Frequently this is dificult or impossible, so we need other tests for convergence too. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","722 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series It follows from the Integral Test that the series o 1 yn p converges if p . 1 and diverges if 0 , p < 1. (For p - 1, this series is the harmonic series discussed in Example 11.2.9.) ■ The series in Example 2 is called the p-series. It is important in the rest of this chapter, so we summarize the results of Example 2 for future reference as follows. 1 The p-series o ` n-1 1 n p is convergent if p . 1 and divergent if p < 1. EXAMPLE 3 (a) The series o ` n-1 1 n 3 - 1 1 3 1 1 2 3 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 3 1 ∙∙∙ is convergent because it is a p-series with p - 3 . 1.

In fact, o ` n-1 1 n 2 -  2 6 whereas y ` 1 1 x 2 dx - 1 Therefore, in general, o ` n-1 a n ± y ` 1 f s xd dx EXAMPLE 4 Determine whether the series o ` n-1 ln n n converges or diverges. SOLUTION The function f s xd - sln xdyx is positive and continuous for x . 1 because the logarithm function is continuous. But it is not obvious whether or not f is decreas- ing, so we compute its derivative: f 9 s xd - s1 yxd x 2 ln x x 2 - 1 2 ln x x 2 Thus f 9 s xd , 0 when ln x . 1, that is, when x . e. It follows that f is decreasing when x . e and so we can apply the Integral Test: y ` 1 ln x x dx - lim t l` y t 1 ln x x dx - lim t l` sln xd 2 2 G 1 t - lim t l` sln td 2 2 - ` Since this improper integral is divergent, the series o sln ndyn is also divergent by the Integral Test. ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 11.3 The Integral Test and Estimates of Sums 723 Estimating the Sum of a Series Suppose we have been able to use the Integral Test to show that a series o a n is conver- gent and we now want to ind an approximation to the sum s of the series. Of course, any partial sum s n is an approximation to s because lim n l` s n - s. But how good is such an approximation? To ind out, we need to estimate the size of the remainder R n - s 2 s n - a n11 1 a n12 1 a n13 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ The remainder R n is the error made when s n , the sum of the irst n terms, is used as an approximation to the total sum. We use the same notation and ideas as in the Integral Test, assuming that f is decreas- ing on fn, `d . Comparing the areas of the rectangles with the area under y - f sxd for x . n in Figure 3, we see that R n - a n11 1 a n12 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ < y ` n f sxd dx Similarly, we see from Figure 4 that R n - a n11 1 a n12 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ > y ` n11 f sxd d x So we have proved the following error estimate. 2 Remainder Estimate for the Integral Test Suppose f skd - a k , where f is a continuous, positive, decreasing function for x > n and o a n is convergent. If R n - s 2 s n , then y ` n11 f sxd dx < R n < y ` n f sxd dx EXAMPLE 5 (a) Approximate the sum of the series o 1 yn 3 by using the sum of the irst 10 terms. Estimate the error involved in this approximation. (b) How many terms are required to ensure that the sum is accurate to within 0.0005? SOLUTION In both parts (a) and (b) we need to know y ` n f s xd dx. With f s xd - 1 yx 3 , which satisies the conditions of the Integral Test, we have y ` n 1 x 3 dx - lim t l` F 2 1 2x 2 G n t - lim t l` S 2 1 2t 2 1 1 2n 2 D - 1 2n 2 (a) Approximating the sum of the series by the 10th partial sum, we have o ` n-1 1 n 3 < s 10 - 1 1 3 1 1 2 3 1 1 3 3 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 1 10 3 < 1.1975 According to the remainder estimate in (2), we have R 10 < y ` 10 1 x 3 dx - 1 2s10d 2 - 1 200 So the size of the error is at most 0.005.

","724 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series (b) Accuracy to within 0.0005 means that we have to ind a value of n such that R n < 0.0005. Since R n < y ` n 1 x 3 dx - 1 2n 2 we want 1 2 n 2 , 0.0005 Solving this inequality, we get n 2 . 1 0.001 - 1000 or n . s1000 < 31.6 We need 32 terms to ensure accuracy to within 0.0005. ■ If we add s n to each side of the inequalities in (2), we get s n 1 y ` n11 f s xd dx < s < s n 1 y ` n f s xd dx 3 because s n 1 R n - s. The inequalities in (3) give a lower bound and an upper bound for s. They provide a more accurate approximation to the sum of the series than the par- tial sum s n does. EXAMPLE 6 Use (3) with n - 10 to estimate the sum of the series o ` n-1 1 n 3 . SOLUTION The inequalities in (3) become s 10 1 y ` 11 1 x 3 dx < s < s 10 1 y ` 10 1 x 3 dx From Example 5 we know that y ` n 1 x 3 dx - 1 2n 2 so s 10 1 1 2s11d 2 < s < s 10 1 1 2s10d 2 Using s 10 < 1.197532, we get 1.201664 < s < 1.202532 If we approximate s by the midpoint of this interval, then the error is at most half the length of the interval. So o ` n-1 1 n 3 < 1.2021 with error , 0.0005 ■ If we compare Example 6 with Example 5, we see that the improved estimate in (3) can be much better than the estimate s < s n . To make the error smaller than 0.0005 we had to use 32 terms in Example 5 but only 10 terms in Example 6. Although Euler was able to calculate the exact sum of the p-series for p - 2, nobody has been able to ind the exact sum for p - 3. In Example 6, however, we show how to estimate this sum.

","SECTION 11.3 The Integral Test and Estimates of Sums 725 Proof of the Integral Test We have already seen the basic idea behind the proof of the Integral Test in Figures 1 and 2 for the series o 1 yn 2 and o 1 ysn . For the general series o a n , look at Figures 5 and 6. The area of the irst shaded rectangle in Figure 5 is the value of f at the right endpoint of f1, 2g, that is, f s2d - a 2 . So, comparing the areas of the shaded rectangles with the area under y - f s xd from 1 to n, we see that a 2 1 a 3 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 a n < y n 1 f s xd dx (Notice that this inequality depends on the fact that f is decreasing.) Likewise, Figure 6 shows that y n 1 f s xd dx < a 1 1 a 2 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 a n21 (i) If y ` 1 f s xd dx is convergent, then (4) gives o n i-2 a i < y n 1 f s xd dx < y ` 1 f s xd dx since f s xd > 0. Therefore s n - a 1 1 o n i-2 a i < a 1 1 y ` 1 f s xd dx - M, say Since s n < M for all n, the sequence hs n j is bounded above. Also s n11 - s n 1 a n11 > s n since a n11 - f sn 1 1d > 0. Thus hs n j is an increasing bounded sequence and so it is convergent by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem (11.1.12). This means that o a n is convergent. (ii) If y ` 1 f s xd dx is divergent, then y n 1 f s xd dx l ` as n l ` because f s xd > 0. But (5) gives y n 1 f s xd dx < o n21 i-1 a i - s n21 and so s n21 l `. This implies that s n l ` and so o a n diverges. ■ 0 x y 1 2 3 4 5 . . . n y=ƒ a n a™ a£ a¢ a∞ FIGURE 5 4 0 x y 1 2 3 4 5 . . . n y=ƒ a™ a£ a¢ a¡ a n-1 FIGURE 6 5 1.

Find all values of c for which the following series converges. o ` n-1 S c n 2 1 n 1 1 D In the comparison tests the idea is to compare a given series with a series that is known to be convergent or divergent. For instance, the series o ` n-1 1 2 n 1 1 reminds us of the series o ` n-1 1 y2 n , which is a geometric series with a - 1 2 and r - 1 2 and is therefore convergent. Because the series (1) is so similar to a convergent series, we have the feeling that it too must be convergent. Indeed, it is. The inequality 1 2 n 1 1 , 1 2 n shows that our given series (1) has smaller terms than those of the geometric series and therefore all its partial sums are also smaller than 1 (the sum of the geometric series). This means that its partial sums form a bounded increasing sequence, which is conver- gent. It also follows that the sum of the series is less than the sum of the geometric series: o ` n-1 1 2 n 1 1 , 1 Similar reasoning can be used to prove the following test, which applies only to series whose terms are positive. The irst part says that if we have a series whose terms are smaller than those of a known convergent series, then our series is also convergent. The second part says that if we start with a series whose terms are larger than those of a known divergent series, then it too is divergent. The Comparison Test Suppose that o a n and o b n are series with positive terms. (i) If o b n is convergent and a n < b n for all n, then o a n is also convergent. (ii) If o b n is divergent and a n > b n for all n, then o a n is also divergent. 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","728 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series PROOF (i) Let s n - o n i-1 a i t n - o n i-1 b i t - o ` n-1 b n Since both series have positive terms, the sequences h s n j and h t n j are increasing ss n11 - s n 1 a n11 > s n d. Also t n l t, so t n < t for all n. Since a i < b i , we have s n < t n . Thus s n < t for all n. This means that h s n j is increasing and bounded above and there- fore converges by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem. Thus o a n converges. (ii) If o b n is divergent, then t n l ` (since h t n j is increasing). But a i > b i so s n > t n . Thus s n l `. Therefore o a n diverges. ■ In using the Comparison Test we must, of course, have some known series o b n for the purpose of comparison. Most of the time we use one of these series: • A p -series 3o 1 yn p converges if p . 1 and diverges if p < 1; see (11.3.1)4 • A geometric series 3o ar n21 converges if | r | , 1 and diverges if | r | > 1 ; see (11.2.4)4 EXAMPLE 1 Determine whether the series o ` n-1 5 2n 2 1 4n 1 3 converges or diverges. SOLUTION For large n the dominant term in the denominator is 2n 2 , so we compare the given series with the series o 5 ys2n 2 d. Observe that 5 2n 2 1 4n 1 3 , 5 2n 2 because the left side has a bigger denominator. (In the notation of the Comparison Test, a n is the left side and b n is the right side.) We know that o ` n-1 5 2n 2 - 5 2 o ` n-1 1 n 2 is convergent because it’s a constant times a p-series with p - 2 . 1. Therefore o ` n-1 5 2n 2 1 4n 1 3 is convergent by part (i) of the Comparison Test. ■ NOTE 1 Although the condition a n < b n or a n > b n in the Comparison Test is given for all n, we need verify only that it holds for n > N, where N is some ixed integer, because the convergence of a series is not affected by a inite number of terms. This is illustrated in the next example. EXAMPLE 2 Test the series o ` k-1 ln k k for convergence or divergence. SOLUTION We used the Integral Test to test this series in Example 11.3.4, but we can also test it by comparing it with the harmonic series. Observe that ln k . 1 for k > 3 and so ln k k . 1 k k > 3 It is important to keep in mind the distinction between a sequence and a series. A sequence is a list of numbers, whereas a series is a sum. With every series o an there are associated two sequences: the sequence hanj of terms and the sequence hsnj of partial sums.

","SECTION 11.4 The Comparison Tests 729 We know that o 1 yk is divergent ( p-series with p - 1). Thus the given series is diver- gent by the Comparison Test. ■ NOTE 2 The terms of the series being tested must be smaller than those of a conver- gent series or larger than those of a divergent series. If the terms are larger than the terms of a convergent series or smaller than those of a divergent series, then the Comparison Test doesn’t apply. Consider, for instance, the series o ` n-1 1 2 n 2 1 The inequality 1 2 n 2 1 . 1 2 n is useless as far as the Comparison Test is concerned because o b n - o ( 1 2 ) n is convergent and a n . b n . Nonetheless, we have the feeling that o 1 ys2 n 2 1d ought to be convergent because it is very similar to the convergent geometric series o ( 1 2 ) n . In such cases the following test can be used. The Limit Comparison Test Suppose that o a n and o b n are series with positive terms. If lim n l` a n b n - c where c is a inite number and c . 0, then either both series converge or both diverge. PROOF Let m and M be positive numbers such that m , c , M. Because a n yb n is close to c for large n, there is an integer N such that m , a n b n , M when n . N and so mb n , a n , Mb n when n . N If o b n converges, so does o Mb n . Thus o a n converges by part (i) of the Comparison Test. If o b n diverges, so does o mb n and part (ii) of the Comparison Test shows that o a n diverges. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Test the series o ` n-1 1 2 n 2 1 for convergence or divergence.

SOLUTION The dominant part of the numerator is 2n 2 and the dominant part of the denominator is sn 5 - n 5y2 .

Estimating Sums If we have used the Comparison Test to show that a series o a n converges by comparison with a series o b n , then we may be able to estimate the sum o a n by comparing remain- ders. As in Section 11.3, we consider the remainder R n - s 2 s n - a n11 1 a n12 1 ∙∙∙ For the comparison series o b n we consider the corresponding remainder T n - t 2 t n - b n11 1 b n12 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ Since a n < b n for all n, we have R n < T n . If o b n is a p-series, we can estimate its remain- der T n as in Section 11.3. If o b n is a geometric series, then T n is the sum of a geometric series and we can sum it exactly (see Exercises 35 and 36). In either case we know that R n is smaller than T n .

The convergence tests that we have looked at so far apply only to series with positive terms. In this section and the next we learn how to deal with series whose terms are not necessarily positive. Of particular importance are alternating series, whose terms alter- nate in sign. An alternating series is a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative. Here are two examples: 1 2 1 2 1 1 3 2 1 4 1 1 5 2 1 6 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ - o ` n-1 s21d n21 1 n 2 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 1 4 5 2 5 6 1 6 7 2 ∙ ∙ ∙ - o ` n-1 s21d n n n 1 1 We see from these examples that the nth term of an alternating series is of the form a n - s21d n21 b n or a n - s21d n b n where b n is a positive number. (In fact, b n - | a n | .) The following test says that if the terms of an alternating series decrease toward 0 in absolute value, then the series converges.

","SECTION 11.5 Alternating Series 733 Before giving the proof let’s look at Figure 1, which gives a picture of the idea behind the proof. We irst plot s 1 - b 1 on a number line. To ind s 2 we subtract b 2 , so s 2 is to the left of s 1 . Then to ind s 3 we add b 3 , so s 3 is to the right of s 2 . But, since b 3 , b 2 , s 3 is to the left of s 1 . Continuing in this manner, we see that the partial sums oscillate back and forth. Since b n l 0, the successive steps are becoming smaller and smaller. The even partial sums s 2 , s 4 , s 6 , . . . are increasing and the odd partial sums s 1 , s 3 , s 5 , . . . are decreasing. Thus it seems plausible that both are converging to some number s, which is the sum of the series. Therefore we consider the even and odd partial sums separately in the following proof. 0 s¡ s™ s£ s¢ s∞ sß s b¡ -b™ +b£ -b¢ +b∞ -bß PROOF OF THE ALTERNATING SERIES TEST We irst consider the even partial sums: s 2 - b 1 2 b 2 > 0 since b 2 < b 1 s 4 - s 2 1 sb 3 2 b 4 d > s 2 since b 4 < b 3 In general s 2 n - s 2 n22 1 sb 2 n21 2 b 2 n d > s 2 n22 since b 2 n < b 2 n21 Thus 0 < s 2 < s 4 < s 6 < ∙ ∙ ∙ < s 2n < ∙ ∙ ∙ But we can also write s 2 n - b 1 2 sb 2 2 b 3 d 2 sb 4 2 b 5 d 2 ∙ ∙ ∙ 2 sb 2 n22 2 b 2 n21 d 2 b 2 n Every term in parentheses is positive, so s 2 n < b 1 for all n. Therefore the sequence hs 2 n j of even partial sums is increasing and bounded above. It is therefore convergent by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem. Let’s call its limit s, that is, lim n l ` s 2 n - s Now we compute the limit of the odd partial sums: lim n l` s 2 n11 - lim n l` ss 2 n 1 b 2 n11 d - lim n l` s 2 n 1 lim n l` b 2 n11 - s 1 0 - s Since both the even and odd partial sums converge to s, we have lim n l ` s n - s [see Exercise 11.1.92(a)] and so the series is convergent. ■ FIGURE 1 [by condition (ii)] Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Instead, we look at the limit of the nth term of the series: lim n l` a n - lim n l` s21d n 3n 4n 2 1 This limit does not exist, so the series diverges by the Test for Divergence. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Test the series o ` n-1 s21d n11 n 2 n 3 1 1 for convergence or divergence. SOLUTION The given series is alternating so we try to verify conditions (i) and (ii) of the Alternating Series Test. Unlike the situation in Example 1, it is not obvious that the sequence given by b n - n 2 ysn 3 1 1d is decreasing. However, if we consider the related function f s xd - x 2 ys x 3 1 1d, we ind that f 9 s xd - x s2 2 x 3 d s x 3 1 1d 2 Since we are considering only positive x, we see that f 9 s xd , 0 if 2 2 x 3 , 0, that is, x . s 3 2 . Thus f is decreasing on the interval ss 3 2 , `d. This means that f sn 1 1d , f snd and therefore b n11 , b n when n > 2. (The inequality b 2 , b 1 can be veriied directly but all that really matters is that the sequence hb n j is eventually decreasing.) Condition (ii) is readily veriied: lim n l` b n - lim n l` n 2 n 3 1 1 - lim n l` 1 n 1 1 1 n 3 - 0 Thus the given series is convergent by the Alternating Series Test. ■ Figure 2 illustrates Example 1 by showing the graphs of the terms an - s21d n21 yn and the partial sums sn. Notice how the values of sn zigzag across the limiting value, which appears to be about 0.7.

","SECTION 11.5 Alternating Series 735 Estimating Sums A partial sum s n of any convergent series can be used as an approximation to the total sum s, but this is not of much use unless we can estimate the accuracy of the approxima- tion. The error involved in using s < s n is the remainder R n - s 2 s n . The next theorem says that for series that satisfy the conditions of the Alternating Series Test, the size of the error is smaller than b n11 , which is the absolute value of the irst neglected term. Alternating Series Estimation Theorem If s - o s21d n21 b n , where b n . 0, is the sum of an alternating series that satisies (i) b n11 < b n and (ii) lim n l` b n - 0 then | R n | - | s 2 s n | < b n11 You can see geometrically why the Alternating Series Estimation Theo- rem is true by looking at Figure 1 (on page 733). Notice that s 2 s4 , b5, | s 2 s5 | , b6, and so on. Notice also that s lies between any two consecutive partial sums. PROOF We know from the proof of the Alternating Series Test that s lies between any two consecutive partial sums s n and s n11 . (There we showed that s is larger than all the even partial sums. A similar argument shows that s is smaller than all the odd sums.) It follows that | s 2 s n | < | s n11 2 s n | - b n11 ■ EXAMPLE 4 Find the sum of the series o ` n-0 s21d n n! correct to three decimal places.

Given any series o a n , we can consider the corresponding series o ` n-1 | a n | - | a 1 | 1 | a 2 | 1 | a 3 | 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ whose terms are the absolute values of the terms of the original series. 1 Deinition A series o a n is called absolutely convergent if the series of absolute values o | a n | is convergent. We have convergence tests for series with positive terms and for alternating series. But what if the signs of the terms switch back and forth irregularly? We will see in Example 3 that the idea of absolute convergence sometimes helps in such cases. Notice that if o a n is a series with positive terms, then | a n | - a n and so absolute con- vergence is the same as convergence in this case. EXAMPLE 1 The series o ` n-1 s21d n21 n 2 - 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 2 1 4 2 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ is absolutely convergent because o ` n-1 Z s21d n21 n 2 Z - o ` n-1 1 n 2 - 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 1 1 4 2 1 ∙∙∙ is a convergent p-series ( p - 2). ■ EXAMPLE 2 We know that the alternating harmonic series o ` n-1 s21d n21 n - 1 2 1 2 1 1 3 2 1 4 1 ∙∙∙ is convergent (see Example 11.5.1), but it is not absolutely convergent because the corresponding series of absolute values is o ` n-1 Z s21d n21 n Z - o ` n-1 1 n - 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 1 4 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ which is the harmonic series ( p-series with p - 1) and is therefore divergent. ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","738 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series 2 Deinition A series o a n is called conditionally convergent if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. Example 2 shows that the alternating harmonic series is conditionally convergent. Thus it is possible for a series to be convergent but not absolutely convergent. However, the next theorem shows that absolute convergence implies convergence. 3 Theorem If a series o a n is absolutely convergent, then it is convergent. PROOF Observe that the inequality 0 < a n 1 | a n | < 2 | a n | is true because | a n | is either a n or 2a n . If o a n is absolutely convergent, then o | a n | is convergent, so o 2 | a n | is convergent. Therefore, by the Comparison Test, o ( a n 1 | a n | ) is convergent. Then o a n - o ( a n 1 | a n | ) 2 o | a n | is the difference of two convergent series and is therefore convergent. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Determine whether the series o ` n-1 cos n n 2 - cos 1 1 2 1 cos 2 2 2 1 cos 3 3 2 1 ∙∙∙ is convergent or divergent. SOLUTION This series has both positive and negative terms, but it is not alternating. (The irst term is positive, the next three are negative, and the following three are posi- tive: the signs change irregularly.) We can apply the Comparison Test to the series of absolute values o ` n-1 Z cos n n 2 Z - o ` n-1 | cos n | n 2 Since | cos n | < 1 for all n, we have | cos n | n 2 < 1 n 2 We know that o 1 yn 2 is convergent ( p-series with p - 2) and therefore o | cos n | yn 2 is convergent by the Comparison Test. Thus the given series o scos ndyn 2 is absolutely convergent and therefore convergent by Theorem 3. ■ The following test is very useful in determining whether a given series is absolutely convergent. 0 n 0.5  a n   s n  FIGURE 1 Figure 1 shows the graphs of the terms an and partial sums sn of the series in Example 3.

(ii) If lim n l` Z a n11 a n Z - L . 1 or lim n l` Z a n11 a n Z - `, then the series o ` n-1 a n is divergent. (iii) If lim n l` Z a n11 a n Z - 1, the Ratio Test is inconclusive; that is, no conclusion can be drawn about the convergence or divergence of o a n . PROOF (i) The idea is to compare the given series with a convergent geometric series. Since L , 1, we can choose a number r such that L , r , 1. Since lim n l` Z a n11 a n Z - L and L , r the ratio | a n11 ya n | will eventually be less than r ; that is, there exists an integer N such that Z a n11 a n Z , r whenever n > N or, equivalently, | a n11 | , | a n | r whenever n > N Putting n successively equal to N, N 1 1, N 1 2, . . . in (4), we obtain | a N11 | , | a N | r | a N12 | , | a N11 | r , | a N | r 2 | a N13 | , | a N12 | r , | a N | r 3 and, in general, | a N1k | , | a N | r k for all k > 1 Now the series o ` k-1 | a N | r k - | a N | r 1 | a N | r 2 1 | a N | r 3 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ is convergent because it is a geometric series with 0 , r , 1.

It follows that the series o ` n-1 | a n | is convergent. (Recall that a inite number of terms doesn’t affect convergence.) Therefore o a n is absolutely convergent. (ii) If | a n11 ya n | l L . 1 or | a n11 ya n | l `, then the ratio | a n11 ya n | will eventually be greater than 1; that is, there exists an integer N such that Z a n11 a n Z . 1 whenever n > N This means that | a n11 | . | a n | whenever n > N and so lim n l` a n ± 0 Therefore o a n diverges by the Test for Divergence. ■ NOTE Part (iii) of the Ratio Test says that if lim n l` | a n11 ya n | - 1, the test gives no information. For instance, for the convergent series o 1 yn 2 we have Z a n11 a n Z - 1 sn 1 1d 2 1 n 2 - n 2 sn 1 1d 2 - 1 S 1 1 1 n D 2 l 1 as n l ` whereas for the divergent series o 1 yn we have Z a n11 a n Z - 1 n 1 1 1 n - n n 1 1 - 1 1 1 1 n l 1 as n l ` Therefore, if lim n l` | a n11 ya n | - 1, the series o a n might converge or it might diverge. In this case the Ratio Test fails and we must use some other test. EXAMPLE 4 Test the series o ` n-1 s21d n n 3 3 n for absolute convergence. SOLUTION We use the Ratio Test with a n - s21d n n 3 y3 n : Z a n11 a n Z - s21d n11 sn 1 1d 3 3 n11 s21d n n 3 3 n - sn 1 1d 3 3 n11 ? 3 n n 3 - 1 3 S n 1 1 n D 3 - 1 3 S 1 1 1 n D 3 l 1 3 , 1 Thus, by the Ratio Test, the given series is absolutely convergent. ■ The Ratio Test is usually conclusive if the nth term of the series contains an exponential or a factorial, as we will see in Examples 4 and 5. Estimating Sums In the last three sections we used various methods for estimating the sum of a series—the method depended on which test was used to prove conver- gence. What about series for which the Ratio Test works? There are two possi- bilities: If the series happens to be an alternating series, as in Example 4, then it is best to use the methods of Section 11.5. If the terms are all positive, then use the special methods explained in Exercise 46. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 11.6 Absolute Convergence and the Ratio and Root Tests 741 EXAMPLE 5 Test the convergence of the series o ` n-1 n n n! . SOLUTION Since the terms a n - n n yn! are positive, we don’t need the absolute value signs. a n11 a n - sn 1 1d n11 sn 1 1d! ? n! n n - sn 1 1dsn 1 1d n sn 1 1d n! ? n! n n - S n 1 1 n D n - S 1 1 1 n D n l e as n l ` (see Equation 3.6.6). Since e . 1, the given series is divergent by the Ratio Test. ■ NOTE Although the Ratio Test works in Example 5, an easier method is to use the Test for Divergence. Since a n - n n n! - n ? n ? n ? ∙ ∙ ∙ ? n 1 ? 2 ? 3 ? ∙ ∙ ∙ ? n > n it follows that a n does not approach 0 as n l `. Therefore the given series is divergent by the Test for Divergence. The following test is convenient to apply when nth powers occur. Its proof is similar to the proof of the Ratio Test and is left as Exercise 49. The Root Test (i) If lim nl` s n | a n | - L , 1, then the series o ` n-1 a n is absolutely convergent (and therefore convergent). (ii) If lim n l` s n | a n | - L . 1 or lim n l` s n | a n | - `, then the series o ` n-1 a n is divergent. (iii) If lim n l` s n | a n | - 1, the Root Test is inconclusive. If lim n l ` s n | a n | - 1, then part (iii) of the Root Test says that the test gives no infor- mation. The series o a n could converge or diverge. (If L - 1 in the Ratio Test, don’t try the Root Test because L will again be 1. And if L - 1 in the Root Test, don’t try the Ratio Test because it will fail too.) EXAMPLE 6 Test the convergence of the series o ` n-1 S 2n 1 3 3n 1 2 D n . SOLUTION a n - S 2n 1 3 3n 1 2 D n s n | a n | - 2n 1 3 3n 1 2 - 2 1 3 n 3 1 2 n l 2 3 , 1 Thus the given series is absolutely convergent (and therefore convergent) by the Root Test. ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","742 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series Rearrangements The question of whether a given convergent series is absolutely convergent or condi- tionally convergent has a bearing on the question of whether ininite sums behave like inite sums. If we rearrange the order of the terms in a inite sum, then of course the value of the sum remains unchanged. But this is not always the case for an ininite series. By a rear- rangement of an ininite series o a n we mean a series obtained by simply changing the order of the terms. For instance, a rearrangement of o a n could start as follows: a 1 1 a 2 1 a 5 1 a 3 1 a 4 1 a 15 1 a 6 1 a 7 1 a 20 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ It turns out that if o a n is an absolutely convergent series with sum s, then any rearrangement of o a n has the same sum s. However, any conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to give a different sum. To illustrate this fact let’s consider the alternating harmonic series 1 2 1 2 1 1 3 2 1 4 1 1 5 2 1 6 1 1 7 2 1 8 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ - ln 2 (See Exercise 11.5.36.) If we multiply this series by 1 2 , we get 1 2 2 1 4 1 1 6 2 1 8 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ - 1 2 ln 2 Inserting zeros between the terms of this series, we have 0 1 1 2 1 0 2 1 4 1 0 1 1 6 1 0 2 1 8 1 ∙∙∙ - 1 2 ln 2 Now we add the series in Equations 6 and 7 using Theorem 11.2.8: 1 1 1 3 2 1 2 1 1 5 1 1 7 2 1 4 1 ∙∙∙ - 3 2 ln 2 Notice that the series in (8) contains the same terms as in (6) but rearranged so that one negative term occurs after each pair of positive terms. The sums of these series, however, are different. In fact, Riemann proved that if o a n is a conditionally convergent series and r is any real number what- soever, then there is a rearrangement of o a n that has a sum equal to r . A proof of this fact is outlined in Exercise 52. 6 Adding these zeros does not affect the sum of the series; each term in the sequence of partial sums is repeated, but the limit is the same. 7 8 1. What can you say about the series o an in each of the following cases? (a) lim n l` Z an11 an Z - 8 (b) lim n l` Z an11 an Z - 0.8 (c) lim n l` Z an11 an Z - 1 2–6 Determine whether the series is absolutely convergent or conditionally convergent. 2. o ` n-1 s21d n21 s n 3. o ` n-0 s21d n 5n 1 1 4. o ` n-1 s21d n n 3 1 1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Given any series o an, we deine a series o an 1 whose terms are all the positive terms of o an and a series o an 2 whose terms are all the negative terms of o an. To be speciic, we let an 1 - an 1 | an | 2 an 2 - an 2 | an | 2 Notice that if an . 0, then an 1 - an and an 2 - 0, whereas if an , 0, then an 2 - an and an 1 - 0 . (a) If o an is absolutely convergent, show that both of the series o an 1 and o an 2 are convergent. (b) If o an is conditionally convergent, show that both of the series o an 1 and o an 2 are divergent. 52. Prove that if o an is a conditionally convergent series and r is any real number, then there is a rearrangement of o an whose sum is r. [Hints: Use the notation of Exercise 51. Take just enough positive terms an 1 so that their sum is greater than r. Then add just enough negative terms an 2 so that the cumulative sum is less than r. Continue in this manner and use Theorem 11.2.6.] 53. Suppose the series o an is conditionally convergent. (a) Prove that the series o n 2 an is divergent. (b) Conditional convergence of o an is not enough to deter- mine whether o nan is convergent. Show this by giving an example of a conditionally convergent series such that o nan converges and an example where o nan diverges. 47. (a) Find the partial sum s5 of the series o ` n-1 1 ysn2 n d.

Prove the Root Test. [Hint for part (i): Take any number r such that L , r , 1 and use the fact that there is an integer N such that s n | an | , r whenever n > N.] 50. Around 1910, the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan discovered the formula 1  - 2 s2 9801 o ` n-0 s4nd!s1103 1 26390nd s n!d 4 396 4n William Gosper used this series in 1985 to compute the irst 17 million digits of . (a) Verify that the series is convergent. (b) How many correct decimal places of  do you get if you use just the irst term of the series? What if you use two terms? We now have several ways of testing a series for convergence or divergence; the problem is to decide which test to use on which series. In this respect, testing series is similar to integrating functions. Again there are no hard and fast rules about which test to apply to a given series, but you may ind the following advice of some use. It is not wise to apply a list of the tests in a speciic order until one inally works. That would be a waste of time and effort. Instead, as with integration, the main strategy is to classify the series according to its form. 1. If the series is of the form o 1 yn p , it is a p-series, which we know to be conver- gent if p . 1 and divergent if p < 1. 2. If the series has the form o ar n21 or o ar n , it is a geometric series, which con- verges if | r | , 1 and diverges if | r | > 1. Some preliminary algebraic manipula- tion may be required to bring the series into this form. 3. If the series has a form that is similar to a p-series or a geometric series, then one of the comparison tests should be considered. In particular, if a n is a rational function or an algebraic function of n (involving roots of polynomials), then the series should be compared with a p-series. Notice that most of the series in Exercises 11.4 have this form. (The value of p should be chosen as in Sec- tion 11.4 by keeping only the highest powers of n in the numerator and denomi- nator.) The comparison tests apply only to series with positive terms, but if o a n has some negative terms, then we can apply the Comparison Test to o | a n | and test for absolute convergence.

If you can see at a glance that lim n l ` a n ± 0, then the Test for Divergence should be used. 5. If the series is of the form o s21d n21 b n or o s21d n b n , then the Alternating Series Test is an obvious possibility. 6. Series that involve factorials or other products (including a constant raised to the nth power) are often conveniently tested using the Ratio Test. Bear in mind that | a n11 ya n | l 1 as n l ` for all p-series and therefore all rational or algebraic functions of n. Thus the Ratio Test should not be used for such series. 7. If a n is of the form sb n d n , then the Root Test may be useful. 8. If a n - f snd, where y ` 1 f s xd dx is easily evaluated, then the Integral Test is effec- tive (assuming the hypotheses of this test are satisied). In the following examples we don’t work out all the details but simply indicate which tests should be used. EXAMPLE 1 o ` n-1 n 2 1 2n 1 1 Since a n l 1 2 ± 0 as n l `, we should use the Test for Divergence. ■ EXAMPLE 2 o ` n-1 sn 3 1 1 3n 3 1 4n 2 1 2 Since a n is an algebraic function of n, we compare the given series with a p-series.

The Ratio Test also works. ■ EXAMPLE 4 o ` n-1 s21d n n 3 n 4 1 1 Since the series is alternating, we use the Alternating Series Test. ■ EXAMPLE 5 o ` k-1 2 k k! Since the series involves k!, we use the Ratio Test. ■ EXAMPLE 6 o ` n-1 1 2 1 3 n Since the series is closely related to the geometric series o 1 y3 n , we use the Com- parison Test. ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","746 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series A power series is a series of the form o ` n-0 c n x n - c 0 1 c 1 x 1 c 2 x 2 1 c 3 x 3 1 ∙∙∙ where x is a variable and the c n ’s are constants called the coeficients of the series. For each ixed x, the series (1) is a series of constants that we can test for convergence or divergence. A power series may converge for some values of x and diverge for other values of x. The sum of the series is a function f sxd - c 0 1 c 1 x 1 c 2 x 2 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 c n x n 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ whose domain is the set of all x for which the series converges. Notice that f resembles a polynomial. The only difference is that f has ininitely many terms.

Notice also that when x - a, all of the terms are 0 for n > 1 and so the power series (3) always converges when x - a. EXAMPLE 1 For what values of x is the series o ` n-0 n! x n convergent? SOLUTION We use the Ratio Test. If we let a n , as usual, denote the nth term of the series, then a n - n! x n .

Now | x 2 3 | , 1 &? 21 , x 2 3 , 1 &? 2 , x , 4 so the series converges when 2 , x , 4 and diverges when x , 2 or x . 4. The Ratio Test gives no information when | x 2 3 | - 1 so we must consider x - 2 and x - 4 separately. If we put x - 4 in the series, it becomes o 1 yn, the harmonic series, which is divergent. If x - 2, the series is o s21d n yn, which converges by the Alternating Series Test. Thus the given power series converges for 2 < x , 4. ■ 3 Notice that sn 1 1d! - sn 1 1dnsn 2 1d ? . . . ? 3 ? 2 ? 1 - sn 1 1dn! Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","748 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series We will see that the main use of a power series is that it provides a way to represent some of the most important functions that arise in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In particular, the sum of the power series in the next example is called a Bessel function, after the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel (1784–1846), and the function given in Exercise 35 is another example of a Bessel function. In fact, these functions irst arose when Bessel solved Kepler’s equation for describing planetary motion. Since that time, these functions have been applied in many different physical situations, including the temperature distribution in a circular plate and the shape of a vibrating drumhead.

","SECTION 11.8 Power Series 749 For the power series that we have looked at so far, the set of values of x for which the series is convergent has always turned out to be an interval [a inite interval for the geometric series and the series in Example 2, the ininite interval s2`, `d in Example 3, and a collapsed interval f0, 0g - h0j in Example 1]. The following theorem, proved in Appendix F, says that this is true in general. 4 Theorem For a given power series o ` n-0 c n s x 2 ad n , there are only three possibilities: (i) The series converges only when x - a. (ii) The series converges for all x. (iii) There is a positive number R such that the series converges if | x 2 a | , R and diverges if | x 2 a | . R. The number R in case (iii) is called the radius of convergence of the power series. By convention, the radius of convergence is R - 0 in case (i) and R - ` in case (ii). The interval of convergence of a power series is the interval that consists of all values of x for which the series converges. In case (i) the interval consists of just a single point a. In case (ii) the interval is s2`, `d. In case (iii) note that the inequality | x 2 a | , R can be rewritten as a 2 R , x , a 1 R. When x is an endpoint of the interval, that is, x - a 6 R, anything can happen—the series might converge at one or both endpoints or it might diverge at both endpoints. Thus in case (iii) there are four possibilities for the interval of convergence: sa 2 R, a 1 Rd sa 2 R, a 1 Rg fa 2 R, a 1 Rd fa 2 R, a 1 Rg The situation is illustrated in Figure 3. a-R a a+R convergence for |x-a|<R divergence for |x-a|>R We summarize here the radius and interval of convergence for each of the examples already considered in this section.

","750 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series In general, the Ratio Test (or sometimes the Root Test) should be used to determine the radius of convergence R. The Ratio and Root Tests always fail when x is an endpoint of the interval of convergence, so the endpoints must be checked with some other test. EXAMPLE 4 Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the series o ` n-0 s23d n x n sn 1 1 SOLUTION Let a n - s23d n x n ysn 1 1 .

Thus it converges if | x | , 1 3 and diverges if | x | . 1 3 . This means that the radius of convergence is R - 1 3 . We know the series converges in the interval s2 1 3 , 1 3 d, but we must now test for con- vergence at the endpoints of this interval. If x - 2 1 3 , the series becomes o ` n-0 s23d n (2 1 3 ) n sn 1 1 - o ` n-0 1 sn 1 1 - 1 s1 1 1 s2 1 1 s3 1 1 s4 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ which diverges. (Use the Integral Test or simply observe that it is a p-series with p - 1 2 , 1.) If x - 1 3 , the series is o ` n-0 s23d n ( 1 3 ) n sn 1 1 - o ` n-0 s21d n sn 1 1 which converges by the Alternating Series Test. Therefore the given power series con- verges when 2 1 3 , x < 1 3 , so the interval of convergence is s2 1 3 , 1 3 g . ■ EXAMPLE 5 Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the series o ` n-0 ns x 1 2d n 3 n11 SOLUTION If a n - ns x 1 2d n y3 n11 , then Z a n11 a n Z - Z sn 1 1ds x 1 2d n11 3 n12 ? 3 n11 ns x 1 2d n Z - S 1 1 1 n D | x 1 2 | 3 l | x 1 2 | 3 as n l ` Using the Ratio Test, we see that the series converges if | x 1 2 | y3 , 1 and it diverges if | x 1 2 | y3 . 1. So it converges if | x 1 2 | , 3 and diverges if | x 1 2 | . 3. Thus the radius of convergence is R - 3. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","752 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series In this section we learn how to represent certain types of functions as sums of power series by manipulating geometric series or by differentiating or integrating such a series. You might wonder why we would ever want to express a known function as a sum of ininitely many terms. We will see later that this strategy is useful for integrating func- tions that don’t have elementary antiderivatives, for solving differential equations, and for approximating functions by polynomials. (Scientists do this to simplify the expres- sions they deal with; computer scientists do this to represent functions on calculators and computers.) We start with an equation that we have seen before: 1 1 2 x - 1 1 x 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 ∙∙∙ - o ` n-0 x n | x | , 1 We irst encountered this equation in Example 11.2.7, where we obtained it by observing that the series is a geometric series with a - 1 and r - x. But here our point of view is different. We now regard Equation 1 as expressing the function f s xd - 1 ys1 2 xd as a sum of a power series. 1 32. Let p and q be real numbers with p , q. Find a power series whose interval of convergence is (a) s p, qd (b) s p, qg (c) f p, qd (d) f p, qg 33. Is it possible to ind a power series whose interval of convergence is f0, `d? Explain. 34. Graph the irst several partial sums sns xd of the series o ` n-0 x n , together with the sum function f s xd - 1 ys1 2 xd, on a common screen. On what interval do these partial sums appear to be converging to f s xd? 35. The function J1 deined by J1s xd - o ` n-0 s21d n x 2n11 n!sn 1 1d!2 2n11 is called the Bessel function of order 1.

We would like to be able to differentiate and inte- grate such functions, and the following theorem (which we won’t prove) says that we can do so by differentiating or integrating each individual term in the series, just as we would for a polynomial. This is called term-by-term differentiation and integration. 2 Theorem If the power series o c n s x 2 ad n has radius of convergence R . 0, then the function f deined by f s xd - c 0 1 c 1 s x 2 ad 1 c 2 s x 2 ad 2 1 ∙∙∙ - o ` n-0 c n s x 2 ad n is differentiable (and therefore continuous) on the interval sa 2 R, a 1 Rd and (i) f 9 s xd - c 1 1 2c 2 s x 2 ad 1 3c 3 s x 2 ad 2 1 ∙∙∙ - o ` n-1 nc n s x 2 ad n21 (ii) y f s xd dx - C 1 c 0 s x 2 ad 1 c 1 s x 2 ad 2 2 1 c 2 s x 2 ad 3 3 1 ∙∙∙ - C 1 o ` n-0 c n s x 2 ad n11 n 1 1 The radii of convergence of the power series in Equations (i) and (ii) are both R.

Equations (iii) and (iv) assert that the same is true for ininite sums, provided we are dealing with power series. (For other types of series of functions the situation is not as simple; see Exercise 38.) NOTE 2 Although Theorem 2 says that the radius of convergence remains the same when a power series is differentiated or integrated, this does not mean that the interval of convergence remains the same. It may happen that the original series converges at an endpoint, whereas the differentiated series diverges there. (See Exercise 39.) Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 11.10 Taylor and Maclaurin Series 759 In the preceding section we were able to ind power series representations for a certain restricted class of functions. Here we investigate more general problems: Which func- tions have power series representations? How can we ind such representations? We start by supposing that f is any function that can be represented by a power series f s xd - c 0 1 c 1 s x 2 ad 1 c 2 s x 2 ad 2 1 c 3 s x 2 ad 3 1 c 4 s x 2 ad 4 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ | x 2 a | , R Let’s try to determine what the coeficients c n must be in terms of f . To begin, notice that if we put x - a in Equation 1, then all terms after the irst one are 0 and we get f sad - c 0 By Theorem 11.9.2, we can differentiate the series in Equation 1 term by term: f 9 s xd - c 1 1 2c 2 s x 2 ad 1 3c 3 s x 2 ad 2 1 4c 4 s x 2 ad 3 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ | x 2 a | , R and substitution of x - a in Equation 2 gives f 9 sad - c 1 Now we differentiate both sides of Equation 2 and obtain f 0s xd - 2c 2 1 2 ? 3c 3 s x 2 ad 1 3 ? 4c 4 s x 2 ad 2 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ | x 2 a | , R Again we put x - a in Equation 3. The result is f 0sad - 2c 2 Let’s apply the procedure one more time. Differentiation of the series in Equation 3 gives f -s xd - 2 ? 3c 3 1 2 ? 3 ? 4c 4 s x 2 ad 1 3 ? 4 ? 5c 5 s x 2 ad 2 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ | x 2 a | , R and substitution of x - a in Equation 4 gives f -sad - 2 ? 3c 3 - 3! c 3 By now you can see the pattern. If we continue to differentiate and substitute x - a, we obtain f snd sad - 2 ? 3 ? 4 ? ∙ ∙ ∙ ? nc n - n! c n Solving this equation for the nth coeficient c n , we get c n - f snd sad n! This formula remains valid even for n - 0 if we adopt the conventions that 0! - 1 and f s0d - f. Thus we have proved the following theorem. 1 2 3 4 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","760 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series 5 Theorem If f has a power series representation (expansion) at a, that is, if f s xd - o ` n-0 c n s x 2 ad n | x 2 a | , R then its coeficients are given by the formula c n - f snd sad n! Substituting this formula for c n back into the series, we see that if f has a power series expansion at a, then it must be of the following form. 6 f s xd - o ` n-0 f snd sad n! s x 2 ad n - f sad 1 f 9 sad 1! s x 2 ad 1 f 0sad 2! s x 2 ad 2 1 f -sad 3! s x 2 ad 3 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ The series in Equation 6 is called the Taylor series of the function f at a (or about a or centered at a). For the special case a - 0 the Taylor series becomes 7 f s xd - o ` n-0 f snd s0d n! x n - f s0d 1 f 9 s0d 1! x 1 f 0s0d 2! x 2 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ This case arises frequently enough that it is given the special name Maclaurin series. NOTE We have shown that if f can be represented as a power series about a, then f is equal to the sum of its Taylor series. But there exist functions that are not equal to the sum of their Taylor series. An example of such a function is given in Exercise 84. EXAMPLE 1 Find the Maclaurin series of the function f s xd - e x and its radius of convergence. SOLUTION If f s xd - e x , then f snd s xd - e x , so f snd s0d - e 0 - 1 for all n. Therefore the Taylor series for f at 0 (that is, the Maclaurin series) is o ` n-0 f snd s0d n! x n - o ` n-0 x n n! - 1 1 x 1! 1 x 2 2! 1 x 3 3! 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ T o ind the radius of convergence we let a n - x n yn!.

But the idea of representing par- ticular functions as sums of power series goes back to Newton, and the general Taylor series was known to the Scottish mathematician James Gregory in 1668 and to the Swiss mathematician John Bernoulli in the 1690s. Taylor was appar- ently unaware of the work of Gregory and Bernoulli when he published his dis- coveries on series in 1715 in his book Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa. Maclaurin series are named after Colin Maclaurin because he popularized them in his calculus textbook Treatise of Fluxions published in 1742. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","SECTION 11.10 Taylor and Maclaurin Series 761 The conclusion we can draw from Theorem 5 and Example 1 is that if e x has a power series expansion at 0, then e x - o ` n-0 x n n! So how can we determine whether e x does have a power series representation? Let’s investigate the more general question: under what circumstances is a function equal to the sum of its Taylor series? In other words, if f has derivatives of all orders, when is it true that f s xd - o ` n-0 f snd sad n! s x 2 ad n As with any convergent series, this means that f s xd is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. In the case of the Taylor series, the partial sums are T n s xd - o n i-0 f si d sad i! s x 2 ad i - f sad 1 f 9 sad 1! s x 2 ad 1 f 0sad 2! s x 2 ad 2 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 1 f snd sad n! s x 2 ad n Notice that T n is a polynomial of degree n called the n th-degree Taylor polynomial of f at a. For instance, for the exponential function f s xd - e x , the result of Example 1 shows that the Taylor polynomials at 0 (or Maclaurin polynomials) with n - 1, 2, and 3 are T 1 s xd - 1 1 x T 2 s xd - 1 1 x 1 x 2 2! T 3 s xd - 1 1 x 1 x 2 2! 1 x 3 3! The graphs of the exponential function and these three Taylor polynomials are drawn in Figure 1. In general, f s xd is the sum of its Taylor series if f s xd - lim n l` T n s xd If we let R n s xd - f s xd 2 T n s xd so that f s xd - T n s xd 1 R n s xd then R n s xd is called the remainder of the Taylor series. If we can somehow show that lim n l ` R n s xd - 0, then it follows that lim n l` T n s xd - lim n l` f f s xd 2 R n s xdg - f s xd 2 lim n l` R n s xd - f s xd We have therefore proved the following theorem. 8 Theorem If f s xd - T n s xd 1 R n s xd, where T n is the n th-degree Taylor polyno- mial of f at a and lim n l` R n s xd - 0 for | x 2 a | , R, then f is equal to the sum of its Taylor series on the interval | x 2 a | , R. 0 x y y=´ y=T£(x) (0, 1) y=T™(x) y=T¡(x) y=T™(x) y=T£(x) FIGURE 1 As n increases, Tns xd appears to approach e x  in Figure 1.

","762 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series In trying to show that lim n l ` R n s xd - 0 for a speciic function f , we usually use the following theorem. 9 Taylor’s Inequality If | f sn11d s xd | < M for | x 2 a | < d, then the remainder R n s xd of the Taylor series satisies the inequality | R n sxd | < M sn 1 1d! | x 2 a | n11 for | x 2 a | < d To see why this is true for n - 1, we assume that | f 0s xd | < M. In particular, we have f 0s xd < M, so for a < x < a 1 d we have y x a f 0s t d dt < y x a M dt An antiderivative of f 0 is f 9 , so by Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have f 9 s xd 2 f 9 sad < Ms x 2 ad or f 9 s xd < f 9 sad 1 Ms x 2 ad Thus y x a f 9 s t d dt < y x a f f 9 sad 1 Mst 2 adg dt f s xd 2 f sad < f 9 sads x 2 ad 1 M s x 2 ad 2 2 f s xd 2 f sad 2 f 9 sads x 2 ad < M 2 s x 2 ad 2 But R 1 s xd - f s xd 2 T 1 s xd - f s xd 2 f sad 2 f 9 sads x 2 ad. So R 1 s xd < M 2 s x 2 ad 2 A similar argument, using f 0s xd >2M, shows that R 1 s xd >2 M 2 s x 2 ad 2 So | R 1 sxd | < M 2 | x 2 a | 2 Although we have assumed that x . a, similar calculations show that this inequality is also true for x , a. This proves Taylor’s Inequality for the case where n - 1. The result for any n is proved in a similar way by integrating n 1 1 times. (See Exercise 83 for the case n - 2.) NOTE In Section 11.11 we will explore the use of Taylor’s Inequality in approxi- mating functions. Our immediate use of it is in conjunction with Theorem 8. In applying Theorems 8 and 9 it is often helpful to make use of the following fact. lim n l` x n n! - 0 for every real number x Formulas for the Taylor Remainder Term As alternatives to Taylor’s Inequality, we have the following formulas for the remainder term. If f sn11d is continuous on an interval I and x [ I , then Rns xd - 1 n! y x a s x 2 t d n f sn11d s t d dt This is called the integral form of the remainder term. Another formula, called Lagrange’s form of the remain- der term, states that there is a number z between x and a such that Rns xd - f sn11d szd sn 1 1d! s x 2 ad n11 This version is an extension of the Mean Value Theorem (which is the case n - 0). Proofs of these formulas, together with discussions of how to use them to solve the examples of Sections 11.10 and 11.11, are given on the website www.stewartcalculus.com Click on Additional Topics and then on Formulas for the Remainder Term in Taylor series. 10 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 11.10 Taylor and Maclaurin Series 763 This is true because we know from Example 1 that the series o x n yn! converges for all x and so its nth term approaches 0. EXAMPLE 2 Prove that e x is equal to the sum of its Maclaurin series. SOLUTION If f s xd - e x , then f sn11d s xd - e x for all n. If d is any positive number and | x | < d, then | f sn11d s xd | - e x < e d . So Taylor’s Inequality, with a - 0 and M - e d , says that | R n s xd | < e d sn 1 1d! | x | n11 for | x | < d Notice that the same constant M - e d works for every value of n. But, from Equa- tion 10, we have lim n l` e d sn 1 1d! | x | n11 - e d lim n l` | x | n11 sn 1 1d! - 0 It follows from the Squeeze Theorem that lim n l ` | R n s xd | - 0 and therefore lim n l ` R n s xd - 0 for all values of x. By Theorem 8, e x is equal to the sum of its Maclaurin series, that is, e x - o ` n-0 x n n! for all x 11 ■ In particular, if we put x - 1 in Equation 11, we obtain the following expression for the number e as a sum of an ininite series: e - o ` n-0 1 n! - 1 1 1 1! 1 1 2! 1 1 3! 1 ∙ ∙ ∙ 12 EXAMPLE 3 Find the Taylor series for f s xd - e x at a - 2. SOLUTION We have f snd s2d - e 2 and so, putting a - 2 in the deinition of a Taylor series (6), we get o ` n-0 f snd s2d n! s x 2 2d n - o ` n-0 e 2 n! s x 2 2d n Again it can be veriied, as in Example 1, that the radius of convergence is R - `. As in Example 2 we can verify that lim n l ` R n s xd - 0, so e x - o ` n-0 e 2 n! s x 2 2d n for all x ■ We have two power series expansions for e x , the Maclaurin series in Equation 11 and the Taylor series in Equation 13. The irst is better if we are interested in values of x near 0 and the second is better if x is near 2. In 1748 Leonhard Euler used Equa- tion 12 to ind the value of e correct to 23 digits. In 2010 Shigeru Kondo, again using the series in (12), computed e to more than one trillion decimal places.

","764 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series EXAMPLE 4 Find the Maclaurin series for sin x and prove that it represents sin x for all x. SOLUTION We arrange our computation in two columns as follows: f s xd - sin x f s0d - 0 f 9 s xd - cos x f 9 s0d - 1 f 0s xd - 2sin x f 0s0d - 0 f -s xd - 2cos x f -s0d - 21 f s4d s xd - sin x f s4d s0d - 0 Since the derivatives repeat in a cycle of four, we can write the Maclaurin series as follows: f s0d 1 f 9 s0d 1! x 1 f 0s0d 2! x 2 1 f -s0d 3! x 3 1 ∙∙∙ - x 2 x 3 3! 1 x 5 5! 2 x 7 7! 1 ∙∙∙ - o ` n-0 s21d n x 2 n11 s2n 1 1d! Since f sn11d s xd is 6sin x or 6cos x, we know that | f sn11d s xd | < 1 for all x. So we can take M - 1 in Taylor’s Inequality: | R n s xd | < M sn 1 1d! | x n11 | - | x | n11 sn 1 1d! By Equation 10 the right side of this inequality approaches 0 as n l `, so | R n s xd | l 0 by the Squeeze Theorem. It follows that R n s xd l 0 as n l `, so sin x is equal to the sum of its Maclaurin series by Theorem 8. ■ We state the result of Example 4 for future reference. sin x - x 2 x 3 3! 1 x 5 5! 2 x 7 7! 1 ∙∙∙ - o ` n-0 s21d n x 2 n11 s2n 1 1d! for all x 15 EXAMPLE 5 Find the Maclaurin series for cos x.

It is best to use the Maclaurin series for values of x near 0 and the Taylor series for x near y3. Notice that the third Taylor polynomial T3 in Figure 3 is a good approxima- tion to sin x near y3 but not as good near 0. Compare it with the third Maclaurin polynomial T3 in Figure 2, where the opposite is true. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","766 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series The power series that we obtained by indirect methods in Examples 5 and 6 and in Section 11.9 are indeed the Taylor or Maclaurin series of the given functions because Theorem 5 asserts that, no matter how a power series representation f s xd - o c n s x 2 ad n is obtained, it is always true that c n - f snd sadyn!. In other words, the coeficients are uniquely determined. EXAMPLE 8 Find the Maclaurin series for f s xd - s1 1 xd k , where k is any real number.

Notice that if k is a nonnegative integer, then the terms are eventually 0 and so the series is inite. For other values of k none of the terms is 0 and so we can try the Ratio Test. If the nth term is a n , then Z a n11 a n Z - Z k sk 2 1d ∙∙∙ sk 2 n 1 1dsk 2 nd x n11 sn 1 1d! ? n! k sk 2 1d ∙∙∙ sk 2 n 1 1d x n Z - | k 2 n | n 1 1 | x | - Z 1 2 k n Z 1 1 1 n | x | l | x | as n l ` Thus, by the Ratio Test, the binomial series converges if | x | , 1 and diverges if | x | . 1. ■ The traditional notation for the coeficients in the binomial series is S k n D - k sk 2 1dsk 2 2d ∙∙∙ sk 2 n 1 1d n! and these numbers are called the binomial coeficients.

","SECTION 11.10 Taylor and Maclaurin Series 767 The following theorem states that s1 1 xd k is equal to the sum of its Maclaurin series. It is possible to prove this by showing that the remainder term R n s xd approaches 0, but that turns out to be quite dificult. The proof outlined in Exercise 85 is much easier. 17 The Binomial Series If k is any real number and | x | , 1, then s1 1 xd k - o ` n-0 S k n D x n - 1 1 kx 1 k sk 2 1d 2! x 2 1 k sk 2 1dsk 2 2d 3! x 3 1 ∙∙∙ Although the binomial series always converges when | x | , 1, the question of whether or not it converges at the endpoints, 61, depends on the value of k. It turns out that the series converges at 1 if 21 , k < 0 and at both endpoints if k > 0. Notice that if k is a pos- itive integer and n . k, then the expression for ( k n ) contains a factor sk 2 kd, so ( k n ) - 0 for n . k. This means that the series terminates and reduces to the ordinary Binomial Theorem when k is a positive integer. (See Reference Page 1.) EXAMPLE 9 Find the Maclaurin series for the function f s xd - 1 s4 2 x and its radius of convergence.

SOLUTION With sigma notation we can write the given series as o ` n-1 s21d n21 1 n ? 2 n - o ` n-1 s21d n21 ( 1 2 ) n n Then from Table 1 we see that this series matches the entry for lns1 1 xd with x - 1 2 . So o ` n-1 s21d n21 1 n ? 2 n - lns1 1 1 2 d - ln 3 2 ■ One reason that Taylor series are important is that they enable us to integrate functions that we couldn’t previously handle. In fact, in the introduction to this chapter we mentioned that Newton often integrated functions by irst expressing them as power series and then integrating the series term by term. The function f s xd - e 2x 2 can’t be integrated by tech- niques discussed so far because its antiderivative is not an elementary function (see Sec- tion 7.5). In the following example we use Newton’s idea to integrate this function. EXAMPLE 11 (a) Evaluate y e 2x 2 dx as an ininite series. (b) Evaluate y 1 0 e 2x 2 dx correct to within an error of 0.001. SOLUTION (a) First we ind the Maclaurin series for f s xd - e 2x 2 . Although it’s possible to use the direct method, let’s ind it simply by replacing x with 2x 2 in the series for e x given in TEC Module 11.10/11.11 enables you to see how successive Taylor polyno- mials approach the original function.

AN ELUSIVE LIMIT CAS WRITING PROJECT The Binomial Theorem, which gives the expansion of sa 1 bd k , was known to Chinese mathe- maticians many centuries before the time of Newton for the case where the exponent k is a positive integer. In 1665, when he was 22, Newton was the irst to discover the ininite series expansion of sa 1 bd k when k is a fractional exponent (positive or negative). He didn’t publish his discovery, but he stated it and gave examples of how to use it in a letter (now called the epis- tola prior) dated June 13, 1676, that he sent to Henry Oldenburg, secretary of the Royal Society of London, to transmit to Leibniz. When Leibniz replied, he asked how Newton had discovered the binomial series. Newton wrote a second letter, the epistola posterior of October 24, 1676, in which he explained in great detail how he arrived at his discovery by a very indirect route. He was investigating the areas under the curves y - s1 2 x 2 d ny2 from 0 to x for n - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . . These are easy to calculate if n is even. By observing patterns and interpolating, Newton was able to guess the answers for odd values of n. Then he realized he could get the same answers by expressing s1 2 x 2 d ny2 as an ininite series. Write a report on Newton’s discovery of the binomial series. Start by giving the statement of the binomial series in Newton’s notation (see the epistola prior on page 285 of [4] or page 402 of [2]). Explain why Newton’s version is equivalent to Theorem 17 on page 767. Then read Newton’s epistola posterior (page 287 in [4] or page 404 in [2]) and explain the patterns that Newton discovered in the areas under the curves y - s1 2 x 2 d ny2 . Show how he was able to guess the areas under the remaining curves and how he veriied his answers. Finally, explain how these discoveries led to the binomial series.

","774 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series In this section we explore two types of applications of Taylor polynomials. First we look at how they are used to approximate functions––computer scientists like them because polynomials are the simplest of functions. Then we investigate how physicists and engi- neers use them in such ields as relativity, optics, blackbody radiation, electric dipoles, the velocity of water waves, and building highways across a desert. Approximating Functions by Polynomials Suppose that f s xd is equal to the sum of its Taylor series at a: f s xd - o ` n-0 f snd sad n! s x 2 ad n In Section 11.10 we introduced the notation T n s xd for the nth partial sum of this series and called it the nth-degree Taylor polynomial of f at a. Thus T n s xd - o n i-0 f si d sad i! s x 2 ad i - f sad 1 f 9 sad 1! s x 2 ad 1 f 0sad 2! s x 2 ad 2 1 ∙∙∙ 1 f snd sad n! s x 2 ad n Since f is the sum of its Taylor series, we know that T n s xd l f s xd as n l ` and so T n can be used as an approximation to f : f s xd< T n s xd. Notice that the irst-degree Taylor polynomial T 1 s xd - f sad 1 f 9 sads x 2 ad is the same as the linearization of f at a that we discussed in Section 3.10. Notice also that T 1 and its derivative have the same values at a that f and f 9 have. In general, it can be shown that the derivatives of T n at a agree with those of f up to and including deriva- tives of order n. To illustrate these ideas let’s take another look at the graphs of y - e x and its irst few Taylor polynomials, as shown in Figure 1. The graph of T 1 is the tangent line to y - e x at s0, 1d; this tangent line is the best linear approximation to e x near s0, 1d. The graph of T 2 is the parabola y - 1 1 x 1 x 2 y2, and the graph of T 3 is the cubic curve y - 1 1 x 1 x 2 y2 1 x 3 y6, which is a closer it to the exponential curve y - e x than T 2 . The next Taylor polynomial T 4 would be an even better approximation, and so on. The values in the table give a numerical demonstration of the convergence of the Tay- lor polynomials T n s xd to the function y - e x . We see that when x - 0.2 the convergence is very rapid, but when x - 3 it is somewhat slower. In fact, the farther x is from 0, the more slowly T n s xd converges to e x . When using a Taylor polynomial T n to approximate a function f , we have to ask the questions: How good an approximation is it? How large should we take n to be in order to achieve a desired accuracy? To answer these questions we need to look at the absolute value of the remainder: | R n s xd | - | f s xd 2 T n s xd | 0 x y y=´ y=T£(x) (0, 1) y=T™(x) y=T¡(x) FIGURE 1 x - 0.2 x - 3.0 T2s xd 1.220000 8.500000 T4s xd 1.221400 16.375000 T6s xd 1.221403 19.412500 T8s xd 1.221403 20.009152 T10s xd 1.221403 20.079665 e x 1.221403 20.085537 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 11.11 Applications of Taylor Polynomials 775 There are three possible methods for estimating the size of the error: 1. If a graphing device is available, we can use it to graph | R n s xd | and thereby estimate the error. 2. If the series happens to be an alternating series, we can use the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. 3. In all cases we can use Taylor’s Inequality (Theorem 11.10.9), which says that if | f sn11d s xd | < M, then | R n s xd | < M sn 1 1d! | x 2 a | n11 EXAMPLE 1 (a) Approximate the function f s xd - s 3 x by a Taylor polynomial of degree 2 at a - 8. (b) How accurate is this approximation when 7 < x < 9?

But we can use Taylor’s Inequality with n - 2 and a - 8: | R 2 s xd | < M 3! | x 2 8 | 3 where | f -sxd | < M . Because x > 7, we have x 8y3 > 7 8y3 and so f -s xd - 10 27 ? 1 x 8y3 < 10 27 ? 1 7 8y3 , 0.0021 Therefore we can take M - 0.0021. Also 7 < x < 9, so 21 < x 2 8 < 1 and | x 2 8 | < 1. Then Taylor’s Inequality gives | R 2 s xd | < 0.0021 3! ? 1 3 - 0.0021 6 , 0.0004 Thus, if 7 < x < 9, the approximation in part (a) is accurate to within 0.0004. ■ Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","776 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series Let’s use a graphing device to check the calculation in Example 1. Figure 2 shows that the graphs of y - s 3 x and y - T 2 s xd are very close to each other when x is near 8. Figure 3 shows the graph of | R 2 s xd | computed from the expression | R 2 s xd | - | s 3 x 2 T 2 s xd | We see from the graph that | R 2 s xd | , 0.0003 when 7 < x < 9. Thus the error estimate from graphical methods is slightly better than the error estimate from Taylor’s Inequality in this case. EXAMPLE 2 (a) What is the maximum error possible in using the approximation sin x < x 2 x 3 3! 1 x 5 5! when 20.3 < x < 0.3? Use this approximation to ind sin 12° correct to six decimal places. (b) For what values of x is this approximation accurate to within 0.00005? SOLUTION (a) Notice that the Maclaurin series sin x - x 2 x 3 3! 1 x 5 5! 2 x 7 7! 1 ∙∙∙ is alternating for all nonzero values of x, and the successive terms decrease in size because | x | , 1, so we can use the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. The error in approximating sin x by the irst three terms of its Maclaurin series is at most Z x 7 7! Z - | x | 7 5040 If 20.3 < x < 0.3, then | x | < 0.3, so the error is smaller than s0.3d 7 5040 < 4.3 3 10 28 To ind sin 12° we irst convert to radian measure: sin 12° - sin S 12 180 D - sin S  15 D <  15 2 S  15 D 3 1 3! 1 S  15 D 5 1 5! < 0.20791169 Thus, correct to six decimal places, sin 12° < 0.207912.

","SECTION 11.11 Applications of Taylor Polynomials 777 Solving this inequality for x, we get | x | 7 , 0.252 or | x | , s0.252d 1y7 < 0.821 So the given approximation is accurate to within 0.00005 when | x | , 0.82. ■ What if we use Taylor’s Inequality to solve Example 2? Since f s7d s xd - 2cos x, we have | f s7d s xd | < 1 and so | R 6 s xd | < 1 7! | x | 7 So we get the same estimates as with the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. What about graphical methods? Figure 4 shows the graph of | R 6 s xd | - | sin x 2 ( x 2 1 6 x 3 1 1 120 x 5 ) | and we see from it that | R 6 s xd | , 4.3 3 10 28 when | x | < 0.3. This is the same estimate that we obtained in Example 2. For part (b) we want | R 6 s xd | , 0.00005, so we graph both y - | R 6 s xd | and y - 0.00005 in Figure 5. By placing the cursor on the right inter- section point we ind that the inequality is satisied when | x | , 0.82. Again this is the same estimate that we obtained in the solution to Example 2. If we had been asked to approximate sin 72° instead of sin 12° in Example 2, it would have been wise to use the Taylor polynomials at a - y3 (instead of a - 0) because they are better approximations to sin x for values of x close to y3. Notice that 72° is close to 60° (or y3 radians) and the derivatives of sin x are easy to compute at y3. Figure 6 shows the graphs of the Maclaurin polynomial approximations T 1 s xd - x T 3 s xd - x 2 x 3 3! T 5 s xd - x 2 x 3 3! 1 x 5 5! T 7 s xd - x 2 x 3 3! 1 x 5 5! 2 x 7 7! to the sine curve.

For instance, when you press the sin or e x key on your calculator, or when a computer programmer uses a subroutine for a trigonometric or exponential or Bessel function, in many machines a polynomial approximation is calculated. The polynomial is often a Taylor polynomial that has been modiied so that the error is spread more evenly throughout an interval.

","778 CHAPTER 11 Ininite Sequences and Series Applications to Physics Taylor polynomials are also used frequently in physics. In order to gain insight into an equation, a physicist often simpliies a function by considering only the irst two or three terms in its Taylor series. In other words, the physicist uses a Taylor polynomial as an approximation to the function. Taylor’s Inequality can then be used to gauge the accu- racy of the approximation. The following example shows one way in which this idea is used in special relativity. EXAMPLE 3 In Einstein’s theory of special relativity the mass of an object moving with velocity v is m - m 0 s1 2 v 2 yc 2 where m 0 is the mass of the object when at rest and c is the speed of light. The kinetic energy of the object is the difference between its total energy and its energy at rest: K - mc 2 2 m 0 c 2 (a) Show that when v is very small compared with c, this expression for K agrees with classical Newtonian physics: K - 1 2 m 0 v 2 . (b) Use Taylor’s Inequality to estimate the difference in these expressions for K when | v | < 100 mys. SOLUTION (a) Using the expressions given for K and m, we get K - mc 2 2 m 0 c 2 - m 0 c 2 s1 2 v 2 yc 2 2 m 0 c 2 - m 0 c 2 FS 1 2 v 2 c 2 D 21y2 2 1 G With x - 2v 2 yc 2 , the Maclaurin series for s1 1 xd 21y2 is most easily computed as a binomial series with k - 2 1 2 . (Notice that | x | , 1 because v , c.) Therefore we have s1 1 xd 21y2 - 1 2 1 2 x 1 (2 1 2 )(2 3 2 ) 2! x 2 1 (2 1 2 )(2 3 2 )(2 5 2 ) 3! x 3 1 ∙∙∙ - 1 2 1 2 x 1 3 8 x 2 2 5 16 x 3 1 ∙∙∙ and K - m 0 c 2 FS 1 1 1 2 v 2 c 2 1 3 8 v 4 c 4 1 5 16 v 6 c 6 1 ∙∙∙ D 2 1 G - m 0 c 2 S 1 2 v 2 c 2 1 3 8 v 4 c 4 1 5 16 v 6 c 6 1 ∙∙∙ D If v is much smaller than c, then all terms after the irst are very small when compared with the irst term. If we omit them, we get K < m 0 c 2 S 1 2 v 2 c 2 D - 1 2 m 0 v 2 √ K 0 K=mc@-m¸c@ K= m¸√@ 1 2 c FIGURE 7 The upper curve in Figure 7 is the graph of the expression for the kinetic energy K of an object with velocity v in special relativity. The lower curve shows the function used for K in classi- cal Newtonian physics. When v is much smaller than the speed of light, the curves are practically identical. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

There are tables that list the values of  (called the temperature coeficient) and  20 (the resistivity at 20°C) for various metals.

","APPLIED PROJECT Radiation from the Stars 783 APPLIED PROJECT Any object emits radiation when heated. A blackbody is a system that absorbs all the radiation that falls on it. For instance, a matte black surface or a large cavity with a small hole in its wall (like a blast furnace) is a blackbody and emits blackbody radiation. Even the radiation from the sun is close to being blackbody radiation. Proposed in the late 19th century, the Rayleigh-Jeans Law expresses the energy density of blackbody radiation of wavelength  as f sd - 8kT  4 where  is measured in meters, T is the temperature in kelvins (K), and k is Boltzmann’s con- stant. The Rayleigh-Jeans Law agrees with experimental measurements for long wavelengths but disagrees drastically for short wavelengths. [The law predicts that f sd l ` as  l 0 1 but experiments have shown that f sd l 0.] This fact is known as the ultraviolet catastrophe. In 1900 Max Planck found a better model (known now as Planck’s Law) for blackbody radiation: f sd - 8hc 25 e hcyskT d 2 1 where  is measured in meters, T is the temperature (in kelvins), and h - Planck> s constant - 6.6262 3 10 234 J ∙s c - speed of light - 2.997925 3 10 8 my s k - Boltzmann> s constant - 1.3807 3 10 223 J yK 1. Use l’Hospital’s Rule to show that lim  l0 1 f sd - 0 and lim  l` f sd - 0 for Planck’s Law. So this law models blackbody radiation better than the Rayleigh-Jeans Law for short wavelengths. 2. Use a Taylor polynomial to show that, for large wavelengths, Planck’s Law gives approxi- mately the same values as the Rayleigh-Jeans Law. 3. Graph f as given by both laws on the same screen and comment on the similarities and differences. Use T - 5700 K (the temperature of the sun). (You may want to change from meters to the more convenient unit of micrometers: 1 mm - 10 26 m.) 4. Use your graph in Problem 3 to estimate the value of  for which f sd is a maximum under Planck’s Law. 5. Investigate how the graph of f changes as T varies. (Use Planck’s Law.) In particular, graph f for the stars Betelgeuse (T - 3400 K), Procyon (T - 6400 K), and Sirius (T - 9200 K), as well as the sun. How does the total radiation emitted (the area under the curve) vary with T ? Use the graph to comment on why Sirius is known as a blue star and Betelgeuse as a red star.

To construct the snowlake curve, start with an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1. Step 1 in the construction is to divide each side into three equal parts, construct an equi- lateral triangle on the middle part, and then delete the middle part (see the igure). Step 2 is to repeat step 1 for each side of the resulting polygon. This process is repeated at each succeeding step. The snowlake curve is the curve that results from repeating this process indeinitely.
